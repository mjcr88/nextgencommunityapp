# Early Test Architecture Input on High-Risk Areas

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Author:** Quinn, Test Architect & Quality Advisor

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an initial test architecture input based on a review of the core project documentation, including the PRD (v2.0), UI/UX Specification (v2.0), User Flows, Fullstack Architecture (v2.1), and Platform Implementation plan.

The objective is to identify high-risk areas early in the development lifecycle to guide the creation of a robust and targeted test strategy. By focusing on these areas, we can mitigate the most significant risks to project success, including security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and critical functionality failures.

## 2. High-Risk Area Analysis

The following table outlines the six primary areas identified as high-risk due to their complexity, novelty, or criticality to the platform's success. For each area, the primary risks are summarized, and a corresponding test objective and initial test strategy are proposed.

| # | High-Risk Area | Primary Risk & Complexity | Test Objective | Test Strategy Input (Early Focus) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **AI Assistant & RAG** (FR4, NFR6) | **Risk:** Hallucination, inaccurate citations, high operational cost, RAG latency. **Complexity:** Integration of OpenAI, pgvector, and unstructured data ingestion. | Validate the accuracy and source traceability of AI-generated responses, and ensure cost controls are effective. | **RAG Validation & Cost Gates:** Implement a **Golden Dataset** of community questions and expected answers/citations. Use automated tests to check citation accuracy (FR4). Integrate **cost monitoring** into the CI/CD pipeline to alert on token usage spikes. Test streaming response performance. |
| **2** | **Multi-Tenancy & RLS** (TA2, Story 5.4) | **Risk:** Data leakage between tenants (critical security failure), authorization bypass, RLS performance overhead. **Complexity:** Core security enforced at the database layer (PostgreSQL RLS). | Ensure absolute data isolation between tenants and validate that all data access paths are correctly filtered by `tenant_id`. | **Security Integration Testing:** Create dedicated integration tests that attempt to query data from Tenant B while authenticated as a user from Tenant A. Use a **Supabase Test Database** to validate RLS policies directly before deployment. |
| **3** | **External Messaging Integration (n8n)** (FR10, Story 5.3) | **Risk:** Data ingestion failure, security of the n8n webhook, message classification accuracy (GPT-3.5-turbo). **Complexity:** Involves external API (Telegram), self-hosted workflow engine (n8n), and AI classification. | Validate the end-to-end data pipeline from Telegram to the Supabase `content_summaries` table, including security and classification. | **E2E Workflow Testing:** Implement a dedicated E2E test that sends a message to a test Telegram group and verifies the corresponding `ContentSummary` record is created in Supabase within the expected timeframe, with the correct `interest_area` classification. Test webhook authentication robustness. |
| **4** | **Real-Time & Location-Based Check-ins** (FR3, NFR4) | **Risk:** Real-time latency exceeding NFR4 (<30s), battery drain, concurrent check-in race conditions. **Complexity:** Supabase Realtime subscriptions and mobile GPS integration. | Validate that check-ins appear on the map instantly and that the time-based expiration logic is accurate. | **Performance & Concurrency Testing:** Use load testing tools (e.g., Playwright with multiple users) to simulate 100+ concurrent check-ins and verify Realtime latency remains below 5 seconds. Implement unit tests for the `expires_at` calculation logic. |
| **5** | **Community Exchange Workflow** (FR8, Epic 4.2) | **Risk:** Transaction integrity failure (e.g., item marked returned but deposit not released), state machine errors (e.g., approving an already reserved item). **Complexity:** Multi-step state machine (`ListingRequest` -> `ListingTransaction`). | Ensure the structured borrow/return state machine is robust and that all financial/status transitions are atomic and correct. | **State Transition Testing:** Implement integration tests that cover all possible state transitions (e.g., `pending` -> `approved` -> `picked_up` -> `returned` -> `confirmed_return`). Focus on edge cases like **overdue items** and **concurrent requests** for the same item. |
| **6** | **Mobile-First Performance** (NFR1) | **Risk:** Failure to meet LCP (<2.5s) and TTI (<3.5s on 3G) targets, leading to poor user adoption. **Complexity:** Requires Server Components, code splitting, and PWA implementation. | Ensure Core Web Vitals targets are met on mobile devices under throttled network conditions. | **CI/CD Performance Gates:** Integrate **Lighthouse CI** into the build pipeline to fail the build if LCP or TTI targets are missed on mobile simulation. Implement E2E tests specifically for the **Onboarding Flow** (Flow 1) to measure total load time and interactivity. |

## 3. Recommendations & Next Steps

This analysis provides a foundation for the formal Test Strategy. It is recommended to prioritize the development of test cases for the highest-risk areas, particularly:

1.  **Multi-Tenancy & RLS:** Security is paramount.
2.  **Community Exchange Workflow:** Data integrity is critical for user trust.
3.  **External Messaging Integration:** This is a core, complex feature driving the AI assistant.

The next logical step is to use this input to create a formal `risk-profile` and `test-design` for each of these areas, which can be executed via the `@qa` agent's command set.
