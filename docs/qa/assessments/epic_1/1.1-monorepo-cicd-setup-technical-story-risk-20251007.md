# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 68/100 (Calculated: 100 - 20 (Critical) - 5 (Medium) - 5 (Medium) - 2 (Low) = 68)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. OPS-001: CI/CD pipeline failure blocking deployment.

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - The initial setup of a complex monorepo CI/CD pipeline (Turborepo, Vercel, GitHub Actions) is prone to configuration errors and integration issues.
**Impact**: High - A failure in the deployment pipeline prevents all new code from reaching production, halting development and feature delivery.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement automated rollback procedures for deployment failures.
- Ensure comprehensive unit and integration tests are run as part of the CI process to validate the build artifact.
- Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release.
  **Testing Focus**: End-to-end deployment pipeline testing, rollback mechanism validation, and build artifact integrity checks.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 1 risk (1 critical)

### By Component

- Infrastructure: 4 risks (CI/CD, Monorepo structure)

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OPS-001 | CI/CD pipeline failure blocking deployment. | Operational | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical | Implement automated rollback; ensure comprehensive testing in CI. |
| TECH-001 | Monorepo complexity (pnpm/Turborepo) leading to build issues. | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Use standard, well-documented configurations; ensure clear separation of packages. |
| TECH-002 | Dependency conflicts across packages. | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Use pnpm workspaces effectively; enforce strict dependency versioning. |
| PERF-001 | Slow CI/CD build times due to monorepo size. | Performance | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low | Implement Turborepo caching and parallelization. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Deployment/Rollback Testing:** Test the entire deployment process, including successful deployment and forced rollback scenarios.
- **Build Integrity:** Verify that the final build artifact contains all necessary dependencies and is correctly configured.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- N/A

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Monorepo Structure Tests:** Verify that cross-package imports and dependency resolution work correctly.
- **Performance Testing:** Monitor and benchmark CI build times to ensure they meet acceptable thresholds.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- OPS-001: Implement automated rollback for CI/CD pipeline.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001, TECH-002, PERF-001: Mitigations are primarily process/configuration-based and should be addressed during implementation.

### Accepted Risks

- No risks are explicitly accepted at this stage.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- CI/CD success rate and failure logs.
- Deployment time metrics.
- Turborepo cache hit rate.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- CI/CD platform or configuration changes significantly.
- New packages are added to the monorepo.
