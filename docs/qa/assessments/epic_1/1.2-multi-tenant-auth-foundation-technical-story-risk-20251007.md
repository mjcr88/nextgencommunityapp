# Risk Profile: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 63/100 (Calculated: 100 - 20 (Critical) - 10 (High) - 5 (Medium) - 2 (Low) = 63)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Flawed RLS implementation leading to data leakage between tenants.

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - RLS is complex and foundational to multi-tenancy security. Initial implementation is highly susceptible to errors.
**Impact**: High - Complete data breach and privacy violation across tenants.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement rigorous RLS unit and integration tests using Supabase testing tools.
- Peer review all RLS policies by a security-focused engineer.
- Use a dedicated testing framework for security policies (e.g., pgTAP or similar).
  **Testing Focus**: Negative testing to ensure a user from Tenant A cannot access data from Tenant B.

## High Risks

### 1. SEC-002: Authentication bypass or weak password storage.

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Custom authentication logic or misconfiguration of Supabase Auth could introduce vulnerabilities.
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized access to user accounts.
**Mitigation**:

- Rely exclusively on Supabase's built-in, secure authentication mechanisms.
- Enforce strong password policies (min 8 chars, number, uppercase) as per Story 1.4 requirements.
- Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
  **Testing Focus**: Penetration testing of login endpoints; testing password complexity rules.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Security: 2 risks (1 critical, 1 high)
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component

- Database: 2 risks (RLS, Tenant ID)
- Authentication: 1 risk
- Backend: 1 risk (Integration)

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | Flawed RLS implementation leading to data leakage between tenants. | Security | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical | Rigorous RLS testing and peer review. |
| SEC-002 | Authentication bypass or weak password storage. | Security | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Use Supabase Auth exclusively; enforce strong password policies. |
| DATA-001 | Incorrect tenant ID assignment leading to data corruption. | Data | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Enforce foreign key constraints on `tenant_id`; server-side validation. |
| TECH-001 | Complexity of integrating Supabase client with Next.js Server Actions. | Technical | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Follow Supabase/Next.js best practices; use a dedicated data access layer. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Security/RLS Testing:** Comprehensive test suite to validate RLS policies against all data access patterns.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Authentication Testing:** Test all login/logout/session management flows for security vulnerabilities.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Integration Tests:** Verify correct data access and mutation via Server Actions, ensuring `tenant_id` is correctly handled.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001 (RLS flaw) and SEC-002 (Auth bypass) must be fully mitigated and verified.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001 and TECH-001 can proceed with compensating controls and monitoring.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Failed authentication attempts (alerts on high volume).
- Database query logs for unauthorized access attempts (RLS violations).

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New tables or data models are introduced.
- Authentication methods are changed or extended (e.g., social login).
