# Test Design: Story 1.1 - Monorepo & CI/CD Setup

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Summary

This story is foundational and highly technical. The testing focus is on **Infrastructure and Pipeline Reliability**. Given the Critical Risk identified in the risk profile (CI/CD failure), testing must prioritize end-to-end deployment and rollback mechanisms.

## Test Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria Traceability)

| Test Case ID | Test Type | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-1.1.1** | Unit/Integration | Verify core dependencies (TS, Tailwind, Zod) are installed and configured correctly in all packages. | AC 4 | High |
| **TC-1.1.2** | CI/CD | Verify successful build and test execution on pull request from a feature branch. | AC 3 | Critical |
| **TC-1.1.3** | CI/CD | Verify successful deployment to Vercel on merge to main/production branch. | AC 2, 3 | Critical |
| **TC-1.1.4** | Monorepo | Verify cross-package imports (e.g., `packages/ui` in `apps/web`) function correctly in development and production builds. | AC 1 | High |
| **TC-1.1.5** | CI/CD (Negative) | Introduce a deliberate failure (e.g., failing test) and verify the pipeline fails and blocks deployment. | AC 3 | High |
| **TC-1.1.6** | CI/CD (Rollback) | Simulate a deployment failure (e.g., post-deploy health check failure) and verify the automated rollback mechanism functions correctly. | N/A (Risk Mitigation) | Critical |
| **TC-1.1.7** | Performance | Verify Turborepo caching is active and reduces build time on subsequent runs. | AC 1 | Medium |

## Test Environment Requirements

- Dedicated Vercel project linked to the GitHub repository.
- GitHub Actions environment configured with necessary secrets (Vercel token, etc.).
- Local development environment capable of running the monorepo structure (pnpm, Node.js).

## Test Data Requirements

- A simple component in `packages/ui` to be imported and rendered in `apps/web`.
- A failing unit test to simulate a pipeline failure.

## Test Automation Strategy

- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Automated via Jest/Vitest within the CI pipeline.
- **CI/CD Tests:** Automated end-to-end pipeline tests using GitHub Actions features (e.g., checking deployment status, rollback logs).
