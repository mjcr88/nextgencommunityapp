# Risk Profile: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 78/100 (Calculated: 100 - 10 (High) - 5 (Medium) - 5 (Medium) - 2 (Low) = 78)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

- None identified.

## High Risks

### 1. SEC-001: Weak password policy enforcement allowing easy-to-guess passwords.

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Relying solely on client-side validation or a weak server-side policy can expose user accounts to compromise.
**Impact**: High - Compromise of user accounts and potential data breach.
**Mitigation**:

- Enforce strong password requirements (min 8 chars, number, uppercase) on both the client and server side.
- Use a reputable password strength library and provide real-time feedback to the user.
- Ensure passwords are only stored using a strong, modern hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt).
  **Testing Focus**: Negative testing with weak passwords; testing server-side rejection of non-compliant passwords.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Authentication Flow: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | Weak password policy enforcement allowing easy-to-guess passwords. | Security | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Enforce strong password requirements on client and server; use strong hashing. |
| SEC-002 | Activation link replay or brute-force token guessing. | Security | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Ensure tokens are single-use, time-limited, and sufficiently long/complex. |
| BUS-001 | User confusion or drop-off during the password setup/onboarding redirect. | Business | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Clear UI/UX for password requirements; robust error handling and clear redirection to the onboarding wizard. |
| TECH-001 | Failure in redirecting to the 6-step onboarding wizard. | Technical | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Unit test the final redirection logic; use reliable routing mechanisms. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- N/A

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Security Testing:** Test password strength enforcement and hashing implementation.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Token Security:** Test token expiration and single-use enforcement.
- **User Flow Testing:** End-to-end test of the activation link, password setup, and redirection to the onboarding wizard.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001 (Weak password policy) must be fully mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All other risks can proceed with compensating controls and monitoring.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Failed password setup attempts (alerts on high volume).
- Activation link usage logs.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Password requirements change.
- The onboarding flow is modified.
