# Test Design: Story 1.4 - Account Activation & Password Setup (Flow 1 Gateway)

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Summary

This story is a critical gateway for new users and requires a strong focus on **Security and User Flow Integrity**. Testing must ensure the password setup is secure and the redirection to the onboarding wizard is seamless.

## Test Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria Traceability)

| Test Case ID | Test Type | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-1.4.1** | Functional | Verify successful navigation from the activation link to the password setup screen. | AC 1 | High |
| **TC-1.4.2** | Security | Verify password setup enforces strong password requirements (min 8 chars, number, uppercase). | AC 2 | Critical |
| **TC-1.4.3** | Security (Negative) | Verify activation link is single-use and time-limited. | N/A (Risk Mitigation) | High |
| **TC-1.4.4** | Functional | Verify successful password setup redirects the user to the first step of the 6-step onboarding wizard. | AC 3 | High |
| **TC-1.4.5** | Functional (Negative) | Attempt to set a password that does not meet security requirements. | System rejects password with clear error message. | High |
| **TC-1.4.6** | Functional | Verify the user's status changes from 'Pending' to 'Active' upon successful password setup. | N/A (Risk Mitigation) | Medium |

## Test Environment Requirements

- Configured email service for receiving activation links.
- Test user created with a 'Pending' status.

## Test Data Requirements

- Valid activation token/link.
- Passwords that meet and fail the security requirements.

## Test Automation Strategy

- **E2E Tests:** Use Cypress/Playwright to simulate the user clicking the activation link, setting the password, and verifying the final redirect.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Automated tests for password strength validation logic and token validation/expiration logic.
