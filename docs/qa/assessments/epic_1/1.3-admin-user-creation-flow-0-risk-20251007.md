# Risk Profile: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 78/100 (Calculated: 100 - 10 (High) - 5 (Medium) - 5 (Medium) - 2 (Low) = 78)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

- None identified.

## High Risks

### 1. SEC-001: Admin privilege misuse (e.g., creating unauthorized users).

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The Admin Backoffice is a high-privilege area. Misuse, whether malicious or accidental, is a significant risk.
**Impact**: High - Compromise of user data, unauthorized access, and potential community disruption.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the Backoffice interface.
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all user creation and modification actions.
- Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all admin accounts.
  **Testing Focus**: Access control testing (ensure non-admins cannot access the interface); audit log verification.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 0 risks
- Security: 2 risks (1 high)
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component

- Admin Backoffice UI: 4 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | Admin privilege misuse (e.g., creating unauthorized users). | Security | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Implement strict RBAC and comprehensive audit logging. |
| DATA-001 | Failure to send activation email leading to user onboarding blockage. | Data | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Implement robust email service with retry logic; provide admin with status and manual resend option. |
| SEC-002 | Activation link/token exposure or weak token generation. | Security | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Use secure, time-limited tokens; ensure links are HTTPS; log token usage. |
| BUS-001 | Incorrect lot assignment leading to data/community confusion. | Business | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Implement input validation and confirmation step for lot assignment. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- N/A

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Access Control Testing:** Verify that only authorized administrators can access and use the user creation interface.
- **Audit Log Verification:** Ensure every user creation attempt is logged with sufficient detail (who, when, what data).

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Email Service Integration:** Test email sending reliability and error handling (retry logic).
- **Token Security:** Test token expiration and single-use enforcement.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001 (Admin misuse) must be fully mitigated with RBAC and audit logging.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All other risks can proceed with compensating controls and monitoring.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Failed activation email attempts.
- Admin activity logs (alerts on suspicious activity).

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New admin roles or permissions are introduced.
- The user creation flow is modified.
