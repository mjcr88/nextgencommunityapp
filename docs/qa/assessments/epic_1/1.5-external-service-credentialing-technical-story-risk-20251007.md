# Risk Profile: Story 1.5

Date: 2025-10-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 63/100 (Calculated: 100 - 20 (Critical) - 10 (High) - 5 (Medium) - 2 (Low) = 63)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Exposure of API keys (OpenAI, Telegram) via code or logs.

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Developers often accidentally expose secrets in configuration files, logs, or client-side code during initial setup.
**Impact**: High - Financial loss (OpenAI usage), unauthorized access to external services, and potential data breach.
**Mitigation**:

- Store secrets exclusively in secure environment variables (Vercel Secrets).
- Never commit secrets to source control (enforce via pre-commit hooks).
- Mask secrets in all logs and error messages.
  **Testing Focus**: Code review and static analysis to ensure no secrets are hardcoded; log inspection to verify masking.

## High Risks

### 1. TECH-001: Failure to validate webhook secret leading to unauthorized external access.

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Implementing cryptographic signature verification for webhooks is a common source of error.
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized parties could trigger content ingestion or other sensitive actions via the webhook endpoint.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement robust cryptographic signature verification for all incoming webhooks (n8n).
- Use a dedicated, well-tested library for webhook signature verification.
  **Testing Focus**: Negative testing with invalid/missing signatures; positive testing with valid signatures.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- External Service Integration: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | Exposure of API keys (OpenAI, Telegram) via code or logs. | Security | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical | Store secrets in secure environment variables; enforce no-commit rules; mask in logs. |
| TECH-001 | Failure to validate webhook secret leading to unauthorized external access. | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Implement robust cryptographic signature verification for all incoming webhooks. |
| OPS-001 | Credentials expire or are revoked, breaking AI/content ingestion features. | Operational | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Implement monitoring and alerting for credential validity/connection status. |
| BUS-001 | Cost overruns due to unmonitored external API usage (OpenAI). | Business | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Implement usage tracking and set hard limits/budgets on API keys. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Secrets Testing:** Verify that secrets are not accessible in client-side bundles or unmasked in server logs.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Webhook Security Testing:** Test the webhook endpoint with various invalid and valid signatures to ensure proper rejection/acceptance.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Connection Testing:** Implement automated tests to verify successful connection and basic functionality with external services (OpenAI, Telegram).
- **Monitoring Testing:** Verify that alerts fire when external service connections fail.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001 (API key exposure) and TECH-001 (Webhook validation) must be fully mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- OPS-001 and BUS-001 can proceed with compensating controls (monitoring and budgeting).

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- External API usage (OpenAI costs).
- Connection status to Telegram/n8n.
- Webhook endpoint error rates.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New external services are integrated.
- Secrets management strategy changes.
