Family Member Profiles (Each with their own platform account)
Daniel Morales (36) - Partner

Role: Backend developer, less community-focused than Sofia
Tech Level: Very high, but skeptical of "too many apps"
Primary Interest: Infrastructure projects, technical systems, efficiency
Engagement Pattern: Passive consumer of info, occasional contributor when technical skills needed
Key Need: Quick access to critical info without noise

Luna Morales (7) - Daughter

Role: Future Real World School student
Tech Level: Kid-appropriate supervised access
Primary Interest: Finding other kids, knowing where activities happen
Engagement Pattern: Would use simplified kid view - events, map of play areas, photos from activities
Key Need: Feel excited and less scared about the move

Mateo Morales (4) - Son

Role: Future Real World School student (younger)
Platform Use: Represented in family profile, not active user yet
Parent Need: Parents need to track his activities, know who's picking him up, coordinate with caregivers

Sofia's Goals & Motivations
Pre-Move Phase (Current - Next 4 months):

Community Integration: Start building relationships BEFORE moving - not arrive as strangers
Practical Preparation: Understand what to bring/not bring, services available, who offers what skills
Real World School Understanding: Deep dive into educational philosophy, meet teachers, understand Luna & Mateo's path
Contribution Planning: Figure out how her UX skills can serve the community (she WANTS to contribute, not just consume)
Family Readiness: Help Daniel feel connected, help Luna & Mateo see the adventure, not just the fear

First 90 Days Post-Move:

Immediate Orientation: Know where everything is, understand workflows (waste management, harvest sharing, community meals)
Social Integration: Make 5-10 genuine connections, not just surface acquaintances
Kids' Transition: Luna and Mateo feel at home, have friends, excited about school
Establish Rhythm: Weekly routines, know when to participate vs. when to focus on family/work
Start Contributing: Join at least one committee or project where her skills matter

Biggest Fears & Concerns
Personal Fears:

Information Overwhelm: Currently in 12 Telegram groups, missing critical info, can't keep up
Cultural Mismatch: "Will we fit? Are we 'eco' enough? Too structured/not structured enough?"
Professional Isolation: Losing her design edge being in rural Costa Rica
Language Barriers: Kids' English isn't great yet, worried about social exclusion

Family Concerns:

Daniel's Buy-In: He's supportive but not as passionate - needs to find HIS place
Kids' Adjustment: New country, new language, unconventional school - will they thrive or struggle?
Financial Unknowns: What ARE the real monthly costs? Hidden expenses?

Community Concerns:

Being Ignored as "New": Established residents have inside jokes and history - will they make space?
Decision Fatigue: Consensus decision-making sounds good in theory - is it exhausting in practice?
Governance Confusion: HOAs not yet formed, who decides what? How do I have a voice?

Current Behavior (Pain Points)
Information Chaos:

Checks 12 Telegram groups daily (construction, permaculture, new residents, Spanish speakers, women's circle, Real World School, events, marketplace, etc.)
Scrolls Instagram for inspiration but it's marketing, not real info
Attended Facebook Live webinars but can't find recordings
Has 50+ saved WhatsApp messages with critical info she can't find later
Created a personal Notion doc trying to organize everything herself

Fragmented Connections:

Had great conversations during her visit, but no way to follow up except random DMs
Doesn't know who else is moving in her timeframe to coordinate with
Wants to connect with other families with young kids but no directory
Met someone offering Spanish lessons for community members - has no way to book or follow up

Daniel's Disconnect:

He's in ZERO Telegram groups ("I'll just ask you, Sofia")
Feels like an outsider in a community he's financially committed to
Would engage if it was dead simple, but current system is too much friction

Kids' Uncertainty:

Luna asks "Will there be other 7-year-olds?" - Sofia doesn't actually know
They've seen Instagram photos but no tangible way to get excited
No kid-friendly orientation or connection point

Tech Comfort Level
Sofia: HIGH - designs apps for a living, early adopter, understands UX deeply
Daniel: VERY HIGH - but values efficiency over features ("less is more")
Luna: MEDIUM - comfortable with tablets, YouTube Kids, simple interfaces
Mateo: LOW - needs parent-mediated access
Engagement Pattern (Current vs. Desired)
Current (Pre-Platform):

Daily: Checks Telegram groups 3-4x/day (15-20 min per session) = 45-60 min/day
Weekly: Attends 1-2 webinars (2 hours total)
Monthly: Posts in groups asking questions, lurks in conversations
Total Time: 8-10 hours/week just trying to stay informed

Desired (With Platform MVP):

Daily: 10-15 minutes checking personalized feed, responding to DMs
Weekly: 1-2 hours actively participating (events, check-ins, contributing)
Monthly: Feels fully informed and connected
Total Time: 2-3 hours/week with BETTER outcomes
