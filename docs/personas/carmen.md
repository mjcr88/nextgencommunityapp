### Carmen's Evolution at Ecovilla

**Months 1-6 (Settling In):**
- Focused on garden and homestead development
- Attended community events, made many friends
- Noticed inefficiencies in resource sharing
- Started lending tools informally to neighbors

**Months 7-12 (Finding Her Role):**
- Volunteered to organize community tool library
- Started coordinating weekly harvest sharing from her garden
- Created Google Sheets for tool borrowing (became unwieldy fast)
- Realized her logistics skills were perfect for this role

**Months 13-18 (Current State - Resource Coordinator):**
- Officially manages community tool library (200+ items)
- Coordinates weekly harvest sharing program
- Maintains contact database for service providers
- Volunteers 15-20 hours/week on resource coordination
- **Experiencing burnout** from spreadsheet management and WhatsApp chaos

### Goals & Motivations

**Community Impact Goals:**
1. **Enable Sharing Economy**: Make resource sharing so easy everyone participates
2. **Reduce Waste**: Ensure tools are used, not sitting in garages
3. **Build Connections**: Every exchange creates neighbor relationships
4. **Document Knowledge**: Capture best practices and contacts for future residents
5. **Model Sustainability**: Show that communities can thrive through sharing

**Personal Goals:**
1. **Leverage Expertise**: Use logistics skills to benefit community
2. **Sustainable Volunteering**: Reduce coordination overhead (currently unsustainable)
3. **Enable Others**: Train residents to participate in resource management
4. **Preserve Legacy**: Create systems that outlast her involvement
5. **Balance Life**: Reduce time on administration, more time on actual sharing activities

**Professional Goals:**
1. **Retirement Transition**: Find meaningful work without corporate stress
2. **Skills Transfer**: Teach logistics thinking to community
3. **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate sharing economy at scale

### Biggest Frustrations & Pain Points

**Spreadsheet Hell (CRITICAL PAIN):**
- **Tool Library**: 200+ items tracked in Google Sheets
  - Who borrowed what, when, return dates
  - Condition notes, maintenance needs
  - Lost or damaged item tracking
- **Manual Updates**: Every borrow/return requires spreadsheet update
- **No Reminders**: Carmen manually messages people about overdue returns
- **Version Control**: Spreadsheet gets corrupted from multiple editors
- **Time Drain**: Spends 8-10 hours weekly just on spreadsheet management

**Communication Overload:**
- **WhatsApp Groups**: 5+ groups for different resource types
  - Tool Library coordination
  - Harvest sharing pickups
  - Service provider contacts
  - Lost & found items
  - Equipment maintenance
- **Individual Messages**: 20-30 DMs daily from residents requesting resources
- **Information Loss**: "I know someone posted about a good plumber last month but WHERE?"
- **Duplicate Questions**: Same questions asked repeatedly (no searchable history)

**Coordination Nightmares:**
- **Pickup Scheduling**: "Mangoes ready Friday 4-6 PM" posted in 3 places, people still miss it
- **Tool Availability**: "Is the chainsaw available?" requires checking spreadsheet + asking last borrower
- **Service Contacts**: Residents ask "Who has AC repair guy info?" - buried in chat history
- **Event Planning**: Tool library hours, harvest pickup times - no central calendar

**Recognition & Visibility:**
- **Invisible Labor**: 15-20 hours weekly coordinating, no one sees the work
- **No Metrics**: Can't show impact (# items shared, $ saved, waste prevented)
- **Appreciation Gap**: People love the service but don't realize the effort
- **Sustainability Concern**: "If I stop, does it all fall apart?"

**System Fragility:**
- **Single Point of Failure**: Carmen is the only one who understands the spreadsheets
- **Knowledge Loss**: No documentation of processes
- **Training Difficulty**: Too complex to hand off to other volunteers
- **Scaling Limits**: Can't grow beyond current capacity

### Current Behavior (Without Effective Platform)

**Typical Wednesday:**
- **6:30 AM**: Check WhatsApp - 15 messages about mangoes, 3 tool requests
- **7:00 AM**: Update Google Sheet with yesterday's returns
- **8:00 AM**: Breakfast with Roberto, distracted by phone
- **9:00 AM**: Garden work - interrupted 3x by tool requests
- **11:00 AM**: Drive to hardware store for tool repairs
- **12:00 PM**: Lunch, update harvest sharing schedule
- **1:00 PM**: Post harvest pickup announcement in 3 WhatsApp groups
- **3:00 PM**: Message 5 people with overdue tool returns
- **4:00 PM**: Field 10 questions about where specific tools are
- **5:00 PM**: Harvest sharing pickup (2 hours standing in garden)
- **7:00 PM**: Dinner, exhausted
- **8:00 PM**: Respond to 20 more messages, update spreadsheet
- **9:30 PM**: Roberto says "You're on your phone too much"
- **10:00 PM**: Can't sleep, worried about forgotten returns

**Time Breakdown (Current):**
- Spreadsheet management: 8-10 hrs/week
- WhatsApp coordination: 6-8 hrs/week
- Physical coordination: 4-5 hrs/week (standing at tool library, harvest pickups)
- **Total**: 18-23 hours/week (unsustainable)

### Tech Comfort Level
**Carmen**: MODERATE-HIGH - logistics pro, used business software, comfortable with new tools if they solve real problems
**Roberto**: MODERATE - practical user, will use tools that work

### Engagement Pattern (Desired with Platform)

**Daily:**
- **Morning**: 10-minute check - review overnight requests, upcoming pickups
- **Midday**: Respond to new listings/requests (batched, not reactive)
- **Evening**: 15-minute close - mark returns, update availability

**Weekly:**
- **Tool Library Hours**: Post schedule to calendar
- **Harvest Sharing**: Create listings when produce ready
- **Maintenance**: Update tool condition, schedule repairs
- **Reporting**: Review metrics (borrows, shares, impact)

**Monthly:**
- **Inventory Review**: Check tool usage patterns
- **Contact Updates**: Refresh service provider information
- **Volunteer Coordination**: Train backup coordinators

**Time Investment Goal:** 
- **8 hours/week total** (down from 18-23 hours)
- **5 hours physical coordination** (unchanged - she enjoys this)
- **3 hours platform management** (down from 14-18 hours)
- **60-75% overhead reduction** = sustainable volunteering
