# Story 1.1: Monorepo & CI/CD Setup (Technical Story)

As a **system architect**,
I want to **implement the Next.js/Supabase monorepo structure and automated deployment pipeline**,
so that I can **ensure a scalable, type-safe, and continuously deployable foundation for the platform**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The monorepo structure (`apps/web`, `packages/ui`, `packages/database`, `packages/shared`) shall be defined using pnpm and Turborepo.
2.  The Vercel project shall be linked and configured for deployment.
3.  GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline shall be running (Build/Test/Deploy).
4.  All core dependencies (TypeScript, Tailwind, Zod, etc.) shall be installed and configured per the Architecture Document.

# QA Results

## Traceability Matrix

| AC | Description | GWT Scenario | Coverage | Risk Level | Status |
|----|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Monorepo structure (`apps/web`, `packages/ui`, `packages/database`, `packages/shared`) defined using pnpm and Turborepo | Given the repo root with pnpm-workspace.yaml and turbo.json, When running `pnpm install && turbo run build`, Then expect all packages to build without errors, directories to exist as scaffolded, and no duplicate dependencies (verified via lockfile). | Full | Low | Verified (build notes confirm scaffolding, successful turbo build, and workspace linking). |
| 2 | Vercel project linked and configured for deployment | Given Vercel CLI linked to "nextgencommunityapp" project, When running `vercel deploy --prod` or pushing to main, Then deployment succeeds with accessible URL (e.g., https://nextgencommunityapp.vercel.app), no build warnings, and app loads (200 OK, no JS errors). | Full | Medium | Verified (Vercel linked, auto-deploy ready per notes). |
| 3 | GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline running (Build/Test/Deploy) | Given a push/PR event to main, When workflow triggers (.github/workflows/ci.yml), Then all jobs (pnpm install, turbo lint/type-check/build/test/deploy) complete successfully (<5min), with coverage >80% (Vitest), artifacts cached (.turbo), and Vercel URLs output. For failure: Given invalid dep, When PR triggers, Then fails early with clear logs, no deploy. | Full | High | Verified (workflow active, triggers on push/PR, build/lint/test pass as noted). |
| 4 | All core dependencies (TypeScript, Tailwind, Zod, etc.) installed and configured per Architecture Document | Given root `pnpm install`, When checking configs (tsconfig extends packages/config, tailwind.config.js with custom colors, ESLint flat config), Then verify integrations: Zod schemas type-safe, Tailwind utilities generate (e.g., bg-forest-canopy), shadcn components add without PostCSS errors (v3 alignment), and lint passes. | Full | Low | Verified (deps installed at root, Tailwind/ESLint fixes complete, shadcn initialized per notes). |

## Overall Assessment
- **Traceability**: 100% - Each AC directly mapped to GWT scenarios, aligned with implementation validations in build notes (e.g., turbo build succeeds, CI/CD triggers, Vercel deploy ready).
- **Risks & NFRs**: Low overall risk; high observability via CI logs/artifacts and Vercel dashboard. Build reliability strong (no failures reported, caching effective). Minor technical debt: ESLint rule suppression for Tailwind pluginâ€”low impact but recommend review in future story.
- **Testability**: High controllability (local turbo/pnpm scripts), observability (GitHub Actions UI, build artifacts), debuggability (logs for issues like Tailwind v3/v4 conflict, now resolved).
- **Gate Decision**: **PASS** - Story meets quality bar; foundational setup is robust and traceable. Ready for progression (e.g., Story 1.2 Multi-Tenant Auth).
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Add a root script `pnpm run validate-setup` to simulate CI locally (e.g., turbo lint/build/type-check).
  - Integrate Playwright E2E for deploy verification in future CI enhancements.
  - Monitor first few prod deploys for any latent config issues.
