# Epic 5: Platform Administration & Technical Foundation

**Epic Goal:** To empower administrators with the tools for gentle stewardship and to establish the core technical architecture required for scalability, integration, and the future SaaS model.

## Story 5.1: Admin Event Moderation

As an **administrator (Marcus)**,
I want to **review resident-created events after they are published and be alerted to potential conflicts**,
so that I can **ensure community safety and coordination without being a bottleneck**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The admin backoffice shall feature an "Event Management" dashboard listing all community events, with a filter for "Unreviewed."
2.  Admins shall be able to mark an event as "Reviewed."
3.  The system shall automatically flag potential conflicts for the admin (e.g., two events at the same location and time).
4.  If an issue is found, the admin must be able to use a "Notify Organizer" feature to send a templated, one-way notification (e.g., "Request Changes," "Conflict Notification"). This system is for notifications, not conversations.

## Story 5.2: Admin Exchange Moderation

As a **resource coordinator (Carmen)**,
I want to **review listings in the exchange and flag or remove inappropriate content**,
so that I can **maintain a safe and high-quality resource-sharing environment**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The admin backoffice shall provide an "Exchange Moderation" dashboard.
2.  Admins shall be able to view all active listings and filter them by category, owner, or status.
3.  Admins must have the ability to "Request Changes" from the owner, "Flag" a listing for further review, or "Remove" a listing that violates community guidelines.
4.  Removing a listing must require a reason and trigger a notification to the listing owner.

## Story 5.3: External Messaging API (Technical Story)

As a **system architect**,
I want to **design and build a robust API for integrating with external messaging platforms (like Telegram and WhatsApp)**,
so that the **platform can send critical notifications and ingest data to power features like the AI assistant**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The system shall expose a secure, well-documented API for sending and receiving messages.
2.  The API must be designed to be extensible, allowing for the future addition of new messaging providers.
3.  The initial implementation must support sending notifications and ingesting message content from at least one target platform (e.g., Telegram).
4.  The API must handle rate limiting, authentication, and error handling gracefully.
5.  This API will serve as the backbone for FR10 and TA1.

## Story 5.4: Multi-Tenant Architecture (Technical Story)

As a **system architect**,
I want to **implement a multi-tenant architecture from the project's inception**,
so that the **platform is prepared for the long-term vision of a scalable SaaS offering**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The database schema and application logic must support data isolation between tenants (i.e., different communities).
2.  Each tenant must have the ability to manage its own set of users, content, and configurations.
3.  The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of tenants without performance degradation.
4.  A clear process for provisioning a new tenant must be established.
5.  This architecture will serve as the foundation for TA2.
