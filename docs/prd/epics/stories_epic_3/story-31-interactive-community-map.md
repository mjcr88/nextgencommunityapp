# Story 3.1: Interactive Community Map

As a **resident**,
I want to **explore an interactive map of the community**,
so that I can **orient myself, find facilities, and see where other residents are (with their consent)**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The platform shall display a GPS-based map showing property boundaries, key facilities (e.g., Community Center), and the user's current location.
2.  Users who have opted-in to share their location shall be visible on the map to other residents. This setting must be off by default.
3.  Tapping on a facility pin shall open a detail view with information like hours, amenities, and who is currently checked-in there.
4.  The map interface must provide controls for layers (e.g., toggle lot boundaries, facilities), zoom, and recentering.
5.  The map must be searchable by resident name, lot number, and facility name.
