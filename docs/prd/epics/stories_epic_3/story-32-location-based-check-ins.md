# Story 3.2: Location-Based Check-ins

As a **resident**,
I want to **"check in" at a location with a brief description of my activity**,
so that I can **share what I'm doing and create opportunities for spontaneous connection with others nearby**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Users must be able to initiate a check-in from the map or home screen. The system should auto-detect their location but allow manual selection.
2.  A check-in must include an activity description, a duration (e.g., 1 hour, 4 hours), and visibility controls (e.g., Everyone, Nearby Only).
3.  Active check-ins shall be displayed on the community map and in the home feed of relevant users.
4.  Check-ins must automatically expire and disappear from active views after the selected duration.
5.  Users shall receive distance-based notifications for new check-ins from others, respecting their notification preferences.
6.  Other users shall be able to give a quick emoji response to a check-in (e.g., "On my way!").
