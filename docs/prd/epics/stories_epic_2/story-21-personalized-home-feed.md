# Story 2.1: Personalized Home Feed

As a **resident (Elena)**,
I want to **see a personalized home feed that prioritizes important actions and relevant updates**,
so that I can **quickly understand what needs my attention and catch up on community life without feeling overwhelmed**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The home screen shall display a dynamic feed organized into sections like "Actions," "Updates," and "Recent Activity."
2.  The "Actions" section shall display high-priority items requiring user interaction (e.g., event RSVPs, overdue item reminders).
3.  The "Updates" section shall aggregate announcements and activities from around the community, personalized based on the user's selected interests and journey stage.
4.  The feed must not be infinite-scroll; it should have a clear end and a "Load More" option to promote mindful engagement.
5.  Users must be able to customize their feed by reordering sections and adjusting notification preferences for different categories of content in a dedicated "Feed & Notifications" settings screen.
6.  A first-time user shall be presented with a welcoming empty state that guides them toward initial actions like exploring the map or calendar.
