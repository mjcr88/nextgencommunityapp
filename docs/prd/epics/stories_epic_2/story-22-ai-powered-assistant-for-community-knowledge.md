# Story 2.2: AI-Powered Assistant for Community Knowledge

As a **resident (Sofia)**,
I want to **ask questions in natural language to an AI assistant via chat or voice**,
so that I can **get immediate answers and find information without needing to know where or how it's stored**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The platform shall provide an AI assistant accessible from the main navigation.
2.  The assistant must be able to process natural language queries in both English and Spanish.
3.  The AI shall be the primary interface for accessing the community's knowledge, retrieving information from a variety of integrated sources (e.g., documents, websites, and ingested content from the External Messaging API).
4.  When providing answers, the AI must cite the original source of the information (e.g., a link to the document or website).
5.  The assistant shall provide a welcome screen with suggested questions to guide new users.
6.  The interface must support both text input and voice input for queries.
