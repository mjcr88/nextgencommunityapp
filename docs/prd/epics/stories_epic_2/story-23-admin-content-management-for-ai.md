**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The admin backoffice shall provide a "Content Management" interface for the AI knowledge base.
2.  Admins shall be able to upload, update, and remove documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCX files).
3.  Admins shall be able to add, edit, and remove web links for the AI to index.
4.  The system shall provide a mechanism to trigger a re-indexing of the knowledge sources after content has been updated.
5.  The interface should show the status of each knowledge source (e.g., Indexed, Pending, Error).
