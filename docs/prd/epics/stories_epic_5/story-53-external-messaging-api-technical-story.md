# Story 5.3: External Messaging API (Technical Story)

As a **system architect**,
I want to **design and build a robust API for integrating with external messaging platforms (like Telegram and WhatsApp)**,
so that the **platform can send critical notifications and ingest data to power features like the AI assistant**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The system shall expose a secure, well-documented API for sending and receiving messages.
2.  The API must be designed to be extensible, allowing for the future addition of new messaging providers.
3.  The initial implementation must support sending notifications and ingesting message content from at least one target platform (e.g., Telegram).
4.  The API must handle rate limiting, authentication, and error handling gracefully.
5.  This API will serve as the backbone for FR10 and TA1.
