# Story 5.2: Admin Exchange Moderation

As a **resource coordinator (Carmen)**,
I want to **review listings in the exchange and flag or remove inappropriate content**,
so that I can **maintain a safe and high-quality resource-sharing environment**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The admin backoffice shall provide an "Exchange Moderation" dashboard.
2.  Admins shall be able to view all active listings and filter them by category, owner, or status.
3.  Admins must have the ability to "Request Changes" from the owner, "Flag" a listing for further review, or "Remove" a listing that violates community guidelines.
4.  Removing a listing must require a reason and trigger a notification to the listing owner.
