# Story 5.4: Multi-Tenant Architecture (Technical Story)

As a **system architect**,
I want to **implement a multi-tenant architecture from the project's inception**,
so that the **platform is prepared for the long-term vision of a scalable SaaS offering**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The database schema and application logic must support data isolation between tenants (i.e., different communities).
2.  Each tenant must have the ability to manage its own set of users, content, and configurations.
3.  The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of tenants without performance degradation.
4.  A clear process for provisioning a new tenant must be established.
5.  This architecture will serve as the foundation for TA2.
