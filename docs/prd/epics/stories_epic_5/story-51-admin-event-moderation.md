# Story 5.1: Admin Event Moderation

As an **administrator (Marcus)**,
I want to **review resident-created events after they are published and be alerted to potential conflicts**,
so that I can **ensure community safety and coordination without being a bottleneck**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The admin backoffice shall feature an "Event Management" dashboard listing all community events, with a filter for "Unreviewed."
2.  Admins shall be able to mark an event as "Reviewed."
3.  The system shall automatically flag potential conflicts for the admin (e.g., two events at the same location and time).
4.  If an issue is found, the admin must be able to use a "Notify Organizer" feature to send a templated, one-way notification (e.g., "Request Changes," "Conflict Notification"). This system is for notifications, not conversations.
