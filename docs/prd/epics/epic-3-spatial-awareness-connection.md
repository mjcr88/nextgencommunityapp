## Story 3.1: Interactive Community Map

As a **resident**,
I want to **explore an interactive map of the community**,
so that I can **orient myself, find facilities, and see where other residents are (with their consent)**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The platform shall display a GPS-based map showing property boundaries, key facilities (e.g., Community Center), and the user's current location.
2.  Users who have opted-in to share their location shall be visible on the map to other residents. This setting must be off by default.
3.  Tapping on a facility pin shall open a detail view with information like hours, amenities, and who is currently checked-in there.
4.  The map interface must provide controls for layers (e.g., toggle lot boundaries, facilities), zoom, and recentering.
5.  The map must be searchable by resident name, lot number, and facility name.

## Story 3.2: Location-Based Check-ins

As a **resident**,
I want to **"check in" at a location with a brief description of my activity**,
so that I can **share what I'm doing and create opportunities for spontaneous connection with others nearby**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Users must be able to initiate a check-in from the map or home screen. The system should auto-detect their location but allow manual selection.
2.  A check-in must include an activity description, a duration (e.g., 1 hour, 4 hours), and visibility controls (e.g., Everyone, Nearby Only).
3.  Active check-ins shall be displayed on the community map and in the home feed of relevant users.
4.  Check-ins must automatically expire and disappear from active views after the selected duration.
5.  Users shall receive distance-based notifications for new check-ins from others, respecting their notification preferences.
6.  Other users shall be able to give a quick emoji response to a check-in (e.g., "On my way!").
