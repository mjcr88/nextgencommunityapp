# Story 4.2: Community Exchange Listings & Requests

As a **resident (Carmen)**,
I want to **create listings for resources I want to share and manage requests through a structured workflow**,
so that I can **contribute to the sharing economy without the chaos of back-and-forth messaging**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Users shall be able to create listings for different categories (e.g., Tools, Food, Services).
2.  Users browsing the exchange can request an item via a "Request Item" modal.
3.  The request modal shall prompt for a preferred pickup time and an optional short message (max 250 characters). Direct messaging is not required.
4.  The listing owner receives a notification and can "Accept" or "Decline" the request. Contact information is only shared after a request is accepted.
5.  The platform must track the status of the borrow/lend transaction (e.g., Active, Due Soon, Overdue) with visual indicators.
6.  The system shall send automated reminders to the borrower when an item is due, and the borrower can "Mark as Returned" to notify the owner. The owner must then "Confirm Return" to complete the cycle.
