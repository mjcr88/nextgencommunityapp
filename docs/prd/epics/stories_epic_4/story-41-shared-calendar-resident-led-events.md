# Story 4.1: Shared Calendar & Resident-Led Events

As a **resident (Marcus)**,
I want to **create a community event that gets published automatically to the shared calendar**,
so that I can **organize a gathering without waiting for admin approval and see all community activities in one place**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  All users shall be able to view a unified community calendar showing all public events.
2.  Any resident can initiate a multi-step "Create Event" flow from the calendar.
3.  The flow must allow the user to specify event title, category, date/time, location (from a list of community spots or a custom entry), and RSVP settings.
4.  Resident-created events shall be published to the calendar immediately upon completion of the flow.
5.  Admins will be notified of the new event for post-publication review (as per Story 5.1).
6.  Users can RSVP to events, and the event creator can see the attendee list.
