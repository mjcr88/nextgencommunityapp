# Out of Scope (For MVP)

To ensure a focused and timely delivery of the Minimum Viable Product, the following features and functionalities are explicitly considered out of scope for this version.

*   **Direct User-to-User Messaging:** The platform will facilitate connection through structured workflows (e.g., sharing contact info after an exchange request is accepted) but will not include a real-time, direct messaging feature between residents.
*   **Financial Transactions:** The Community Exchange and other features will not include integrated payment gateways or any form of financial transactions.
*   **Pre-Publication Event Approval:** All resident-created events are published automatically to encourage spontaneity. Moderation will occur post-publication.
*   **User-Facing Knowledge Base Interface:** The AI-powered assistant will be the primary interface for accessing community knowledge. A traditional, browsable knowledge base is not included in the MVP.
*   **Advanced Admin Analytics:** The backoffice will focus on core moderation and management tasks. A comprehensive analytics dashboard for admins is a future consideration.
