# Technical Assumptions

*   **TA1: External Messaging API Integration**: The architecture will assume the need for a robust, scalable API to integrate with external messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp. This integration is critical for features such as the AI assistant and personalized notifications and will be designed for extensibility to support other platforms in the future.
*   **TA2: Multi-Tenant Architecture**: The system will be designed with a multi-tenant architecture from the ground up to support the long-term vision of a SaaS offering. This includes data isolation, tenant-specific configurations, and a scalable infrastructure that can accommodate multiple, distinct community instances securely and efficiently.
