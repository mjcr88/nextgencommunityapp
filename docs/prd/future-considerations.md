# Future Considerations

The MVP serves as the foundation for a long-term vision. The following key areas are identified for future exploration and development post-MVP.

*   **SaaS Multi-Tenancy:** Fully develop the multi-tenant architecture to onboard other intentional communities, turning the platform into a scalable SaaS business. This includes tenant-specific customization, billing, and administration.
*   **Advanced AI & Proactive Assistance:** Evolve the AI assistant from a reactive query tool to a proactive agent that can make personalized suggestions, anticipate user needs, and automate routine tasks.
*   **Deeper Platform Integrations:** Integrate with other relevant platforms and devices, such as smart home technology for resource management (e.g., energy consumption data) or financial tools for community budgeting.
*   **Gamification & Incentive Systems:** Introduce gamification elements (e.g., badges, points) to further encourage participation in community events, resource sharing, and other positive behaviors.
*   **Expanded Community Modules:** Develop new modules based on community feedback, such as carpooling coordination, child care scheduling, or in-depth project management tools for community initiatives.
