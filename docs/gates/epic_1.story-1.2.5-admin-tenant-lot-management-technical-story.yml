epic: epic_1
date: 2025-10-27
reviewer: Cline (as QA Advisor)

decision: PASS (Implementation)
rationale: |
  Post-implementation review confirms full coverage of ACs with 23/23 unit tests passing, RLS policies applied, Zod validation integrated, and monorepo issues resolved (e.g., relative imports, dependency injection). Backend infrastructure is solid for multi-tenant hierarchy (Tenant > Neighborhood > Lot), enabling Story 1.2.6 UI. Deferred integration tests (3 failing) are low-risk for this repo-focused story; no critical gaps in security or data integrity. Proceed to review and integration.

traceability_summary:
  ac1_database_schema: Full coverage via migration 002 (tables/RLS/indexes verified), seed data 002 (Ecovilla tenant/neighborhoods/lots), and manual RLS SQL checks.
  ac2_zod_schemas: Full coverage via schema.test.ts files (neighborhood/lot validation, JsonZod for jsonb); extended user.ts with lot_id.
  ac3_repository_functions: Full coverage via repo implementations (tenant/neighborhood/lot CRUD, validation, assignLotToUser); pure functions tested in validation.test.ts.
  ac4_server_actions: Full coverage via admin.ts (createTenant/Neighborhood/Lot with auth/Zod/repo calls); helpers like canManageTenant tested.
  ac5_integration_unit_tests: 23 unit tests passing (P0/P1 scenarios: hierarchy, RLS isolation, duplicates); integration optional/skippable, manual RLS verified.
  ac6_seed_data: Full coverage via 002_add_neighborhoods_lots.sql (Ecovilla setup: Almendro/Bamboo neighborhoods, sample lots available).
  ac7_no_direct_messaging: Full coverage via AppError handling in repos/actions (error notifications without messaging).

overall_risk: medium (multi-tenant focus, deferred integration low-impact)
testability: high (controllable via mocks/Supabase local; observable through tests/AppError)
recommendations:
  - Implement integration tests for actions/repos in Story 1.2.6 (cover full hierarchy flows).
  - Add ESLint/Prettier config to packages/database/ and integrate with Turbo CI for linting.
  - Run Supabase local (supabase start) to validate end-to-end RLS in tenant creation flow.
  - Schedule security review for lot assignment (Story 1.3): Test hierarchy traversal and duplicate prevention.
  - Update story file QA Results with gate reference for traceability.
