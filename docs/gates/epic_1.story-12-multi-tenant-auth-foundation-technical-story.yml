reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

decision: PASS (Traceability)
rationale: |
  Pre-implementation traceability established with 100% AC-to-GWT mapping, focusing on security-critical elements (RLS isolation, auth flows). Strong blueprint for multi-tenancy and auth foundation; high risks flagged for early testing. Proceed to dev with security emphasis.

traceability_summary:
  ac1_tables_rls: Full coverage via GWT1 (isolation enforcement, failure detection); planned integration tests.
  ac2_supabase_auth: Full coverage via GWT1 (login/JWT success, invalid creds); auth flow tests recommended.
  ac3_seed_data: Full coverage via GWT1 (DB assertions, error handling); use migrations for idempotency.
  ac4_supabase_client: Full coverage via GWT1 (action execution, config errors); mock for unit tests.

risk_matrix:
  - ac: 1
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: Supabase local + RLS query tests
    score: 6
  - ac: 2
    probability: high
    impact: high
    mitigation: JWT validation and auth penetration tests
    score: 9
  - ac: 3
    probability: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Transactional seeds with assertions
    score: 2
  - ac: 4
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Env var checks in actions
    score: 4

overall_risk: high (security focus)
testability: medium-high
recommendations:
  - Run Supabase local (docker) for RLS/auth testing.
  - Build integration suite with @supabase/supabase-js and Vitest.
  - Use migrations for seeds; add post-seed verification script.
  - Schedule auth security review post-implementation (e.g., JWT tampering tests).

gate_status: open (pre-implementation)
