reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The story implementation, as detailed in build notes, fully satisfies all acceptance criteria with successful validations (e.g., turbo build/lint passes, CI/CD workflow active, Vercel deploy linked). Traceability is 100%, with high testability and low risks. Minor technical debt (ESLint suppression) is low-impact and waived for progression.

traceability_summary:
  ac1_monorepo_structure: Full coverage via GWT1 (build verification) and GWT2 (workspace linking); verified in notes.
  ac2_vercel_config: Full coverage via GWT1 (deploy success); auto-deploy ready.
  ac3_github_actions_pipeline: Full coverage via GWT1-3 (jobs, failure handling); workflow triggers confirmed.
  ac4_core_dependencies: Full coverage via GWT1-2 (configs, integrations); deps installed, fixes applied.

overall_risk: low
testability: high
recommendations:
  - Add `pnpm run validate-setup` script for local CI simulation.
  - Enhance CI with Playwright E2E for deploys in next story.
  - Review ESLint suppression in future refactoring.
