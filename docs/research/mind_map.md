**I. Resident Experience & Engagement**
    *   **Resident Profiles**
        *   Personalization (interests, location, existing relationships)
        *   Customizable experience (e.g., age-related options, larger fonts)
        *   "Attributes" for connecting to services/information
    *   **Connections & Communication**
        *   Ability to connect with other residents
        *   Direct messaging
        *   Group chats
    *   **Community Participation & Input**
        *   Ability for residents to create and send surveys to neighbors
        *   Leverage diversity/creativity of users for input
    *   **Personalized Information Flow**
        *   Residents pick and choose interests
        *   Customize communication/summaries (e.g., based on 50 Telegram interest groups)
        *   Daily/weekly AI summary of Telegram channels, official news, etc. (AI-powered newsletter)
        *   Easy access to source for contribution/questions
    *   **Location-Based Interaction & Discovery**
        *   Community Map (neighbors, infrastructure, paths, trails)
            *   Consolidate existing map app (properties for sale/sold/resale)
        *   "Check-in" at locations (e.g., Yoga shala)
        *   Optional activity description (e.g., HITT workout)
        *   Notifications to connected neighbors/shared interests
    *   **Core Service Access & Dashboard**
        *   Personalized community dashboard
        *   Easy access to core service requests
        *   Easy access to key content
        *   Dashboard content: highly engaged posts, interest-based content, AI summaries

**II. AI & Information Management**
    *   **Agentic Chat/Voice Interfaces**
        *   Retrieve content summaries from various sources
        *   Prepare content summaries from various sources
    *   **Knowledge Base & Data Integration**
        *   Internal knowledge base powering AI solutions
        *   Manage data integrations (for AI solutions)
        *   RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and GraphRAG for advanced information retrieval and knowledge modeling
        *   Workflow automations
        *   Newsletter creation
        *   Summarization of updates
        *   Consolidate existing website content (shared calendar, meeting recordings, common documents)
        *   Structured information with relationships (from existing Google Sheets/Excel data)

**III. Administrator Tools & Capabilities**
    *   **Community-Wide Communication**
        *   Ability to create and send community-wide communications and updates
    *   **Data & AI Management**
        *   Manage data integrations
        *   Manage internal knowledge base (powering AI solutions)
        *   Admin-friendly data input (e.g., via familiar interfaces like Google Sheets/Excel, which then convert to structured data for the app)
    *   **Consolidation of Existing Tools**
        *   Replace standalone map app
        *   Integrate website content (calendar, documents, recordings)
    *   **Backoffice Interface**
        *   Configure community tenants (for multi-tenancy)
        *   Manual user registration by community admins
        *   Assign users to properties by community admins

**IV. Core Data Model & Architecture**
    *   **Knowledge Graph Approach**
        *   Resident as a data object with attributes
        *   Relationships:
            *   Resident to other "residents" (family)
            *   Resident to "property/lot"
            *   Resident to "projects"
            *   Resident to "capabilities" (skills, talents)
            *   Resident to "processes" (e.g., roles in governance)

**V. Advanced Community Use Cases (Future/Expansion)**
    *   Tool exchange system
    *   Time bank system (for skill exchange)
    *   Residents offering services/subscriptions/classes (easy booking/signup)
    *   Mapping various community use cases
    *   Integration with other common tools (to avoid 20 standalone apps)
