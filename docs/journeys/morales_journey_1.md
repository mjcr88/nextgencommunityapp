Gaps & Risks Identified
Critical Gaps:

⚠️ Video Integration: Virtual meetups happening on Zoom (external) - is this okay or should be in-platform?
⚠️ Document Sharing: Sofia shared moving checklist - how? Link to Google Doc or native?
⚠️ Event RSVP: Luna's playdate - is there event management beyond feed notification?
⚠️ Voting Mechanism: HOA vote mentioned but not in MVP scope - flag for later?

Usability Risks:

Daniel's Low Engagement: Weekly digest works but risks disconnection - how to keep him warm?
Luna's Parent Dependency: Kid features require Sofia mediation - sustainable?
Content Overload: Even with AI curation, Sofia could still get overwhelmed if feed algo isn't tuned right
Language Switching: Sofia prefers Spanish but some content only in English - how handled?

Technical Risks:

AI Quality: If assistant gives wrong/outdated info, trust breaks immediately
Mobile Performance: Sofia on phone 90% of time - must be fast
Offline Access: What if internet spotty in Buenos Aires? Can she still access saved content?
Knowledge Base Maintenance: Who keeps it updated? Stale info = big problem
