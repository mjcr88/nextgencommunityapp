Direct & Group Messaging ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Real-time help, coordination)

Feature Upgrade from Pre-Move:

Location-Based Check-ins: ⭐ (Pre-Move) → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Move-In) HUGE JUMP
Interactive Map: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Pre-Move) → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Move-In) CRITICAL
Agentic Chat: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Both) CONSISTENTLY HIGH

Least Used (Move-In):

Backoffice Interface ⭐ (Admin only, but Sofia used for content submission)


Gaps & Risks Identified - Move-In Journey
Critical Gaps Exposed:

⚠️ Tool Library Integration:

Daniel checked out drill - how exactly?
QR code scan? Manual entry? Admin approval?
Gap: Need simple inventory/checkout flow


⚠️ Calendar/RSVP System:

Events mentioned repeatedly (community meals, kids' activities)
Gap: How do residents RSVP? Just via feed notification?
Need lightweight event management (even if simple)


⚠️ Emergency Contacts:

Mentioned in feed, AI provides them
Gap: Should be prominently accessible (not just via search)
Suggest: Dedicated "Emergency" section or quick-access button


⚠️ Photo Sharing in Check-ins:

Sofia posts photos frequently
Gap: How are photos stored/displayed?
Just in feed? Profile gallery? Searchable?


⚠️ Content Contribution Workflow:

Sofia wrote "Survival Guide" for Knowledge Base
Gap: How did she submit? Form? Admin approval process?
Backoffice Interface handles this but needs to be smooth



Usability Risks:

Mobile Performance CRITICAL:

Sofia on phone 95% of time during move-in
If map is slow, check-ins lag, or feed loads slowly = abandoned
Must be FAST on mobile


Offline Functionality:

Rural Costa Rica = spotty internet sometimes
What happens if Sofia loses connection mid-check-in?
Should cache critical info (emergency contacts, map, AI basics)


Notification Fatigue:

Sofia getting lots of notifications (check-in responses, DMs, group chats)
By Week 1, could become overwhelming
Need smart notification management (AI should learn her priorities)


Daniel's Low Engagement Risk:

He's using it but still less than Sofia
If tech group went quiet, would he disengage?
Need to keep his niche community active


Privacy for Kids:

Luna checking in publicly, photos shared
Need parent controls: Who can see kid check-ins? Comment?
Safety feature must be solid



Technical Risks:

AI Assistant Accuracy:

Sofia trusts AI for critical info (water system, emergency contacts)
If ONE answer is wrong = trust broken permanently
Knowledge Base must be curated and updated


Check-in Location Accuracy:

GPS-based system - what if inaccurate?
Sofia checks in at "Lot 47" but GPS says "Lot 48"?
Need manual override option


Photo Storage/Loading:

15+ check-ins with photos in Week 1 (just Sofia)
50+ families doing same = huge photo volume
Need efficient storage, loading, compression


Group Chat Scalability:

"Tech Infrastructure" group has 30+ members
Daily active discussions
Need threaded conversations or topics to avoid chaos

❌ Complex Onboarding: If setup took >10 min = Daniel wouldn't finish
❌ Privacy Concerns: If Luna's photos were public without controls = Sofia would freak out
❌ Dead Groups: If tech group was inactive = Daniel disengages
❌ Missing Critical Info: If emergency contacts weren't easily found = platform seems incomplete
