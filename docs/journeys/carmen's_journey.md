3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Calendar-Exchange Integration**:
   - Carmen wants harvest listings to auto-create calendar events
   - **Gap**: How deep is this integration?
   - **Requirement**: 
     - One-click "Create Calendar Event" from listing
     - Calendar events can link back to exchange items
     - RSVP data visible to both systems

4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Service Contact Quality**:
   - Residents add service providers, but how do we ensure quality?
   - **Gap**: Verification? Reviews? Rating decay over time?
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - MVP: Simple review system (thumbs up/down + comment)
     - Phase 2: Rating aggregation, verified providers

5. **‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-Coordinator Management**:
   - Carmen training Maria and others
   - **Gap**: Permission levels? Audit trails?
   - **Requirement**:
     - Basic roles: Admin, Coordinator, Resident
     - Coordinators can approve borrows, update listings
     - Audit trail of who did what (for conflict resolution)

6. **‚ö†Ô∏è Inventory Maintenance**:
   - Tools need maintenance, sometimes broken
   - **Gap**: How to mark items unavailable temporarily?
   - **Requirement**:
     - Status: "Under Maintenance" with notes
     - Estimated return date
     - Notification to waitlist when available again

7. **‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics & Impact Reporting**:
   - Carmen wants to show community value
   - **Gap**: What metrics matter?
   - **Recommendation**:
     - MVP: Basic counts (borrows, shares, participants)
     - Phase 2: Impact calculations ($ saved, waste prevented)

### Usability Risks:

1. **Exchange Discovery**:
   - **Risk**: Residents don't know what's available
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Prominent "Browse Exchange" in feed
     - AI suggestions: "Need tools? Check exchange"
     - Category browsing + search

2. **Request Abandonment**:
   - **Risk**: Request item, forget to pick up
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Pickup reminders
     - Auto-cancel if not picked up in 3 days
     - Impact on borrower rating

3. **Calendar Clutter**:
   - **Risk**: Too many events make calendar useless
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Interest-based filtering (residents choose categories)
     - Tool library hours recurring (not daily spam)
     - Event priority levels

4. **Coordinator Burnout Prevention**:
   - **Risk**: Platform efficient but Carmen still overwhelmed by volume
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Training flow for backup coordinators
     - Auto-approval for trusted borrowers
     - Clear metrics showing impact (validates effort)

5. **Listing Quality**:
   - **Risk**: Poor photos, unclear descriptions
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Templates and examples
     - AI-assisted description writing
     - Photo upload required (but optional for service contacts)

### Technical Risks:

1. **Photo Storage**:
   - Carmen creates 3+ listings/week with photos
   - **Risk**: Storage costs, load times
   - **Requirement**: Image compression, CDN, lazy loading

2. **Borrow State Consistency**:
   - Multiple people can request same item simultaneously
   - **Risk**: Race conditions, double-booking
   - **Requirement**: Proper database locking, status validation

3. **Calendar Sync**:
   - Residents want events in their personal calendars
   - **Risk**: Sync complexity, stale data
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - MVP: iCal export link (one-way)
     - Phase 2: Two-way sync with Google/Apple Calendar

4. **Notification Overload**:
   - Exchange activity generates many notifications
   - **Risk**: Residents mute everything
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Granular controls (by category, by event type)
     - Digest mode (daily summary instead of real-time)
     - Carmen-specific coordinator view (different notifications)
