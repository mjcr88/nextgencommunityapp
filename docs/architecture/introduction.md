# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Ecovilla Community Platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-05 | 1.0 | Initial architecture draft | Winston |
| 2025-10-05 | 2.0 | Revised to Next.js + shadcn/ui, comprehensive stack definition | Winston |

## Starter Template Decision

**Decision:** No starter template. Building from scratch with Next.js 14.

**Rationale:** 
- The project has highly specific requirements (multi-tenancy, AI integration, real-time features)
- Design specification is extremely detailed with custom component architecture
- Using shadcn/ui's copy-paste philosophy allows precise control
- Supabase integration requires custom setup anyway

**Constraints:**
- Must manually configure all tooling, build pipeline, and deployment
- Full control over every architectural decision
- Longer initial setup but better long-term flexibility
