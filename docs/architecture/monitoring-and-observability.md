# Monitoring and Observability

This strategy ensures we have the necessary visibility to maintain the platform's 99.5%+ uptime and manage costs associated with AI and workflow orchestration.

## 1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

**Strategy:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and Core Web Vitals to proactively identify bottlenecks.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Tooling:** Use Vercel Analytics (built-in RUM) for frontend performance and a lightweight APM solution (e.g., Sentry or Datadog) for Server Action latency and error tracking.
- **Metrics:** Monitor Server Action execution time, database query latency, and external API response times.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for latency spikes (e.g., P95 latency > 500ms) and error rate increases (>1%).

## 2. Logging Strategy

**Strategy:** Implement structured, centralized logging across all components.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Next.js:** Use a structured logger (e.g., Pino or Winston) to log Server Action execution, errors, and security events (e.g., failed login attempts).
- **Supabase:** Utilize Supabase's built-in PostgreSQL logs for database query analysis and RLS policy debugging.
- **n8n:** Configure n8n to log all workflow executions and errors to a centralized logging service (e.g., Datadog, Logtail, or a simple file system for MVP).

## 3. Cost Tracking and Optimization

**Strategy:** Proactively monitor and alert on usage of expensive external services.

**Implementation Details:**
- **OpenAI:** Implement a dedicated cost tracking service or use a third-party tool to monitor token usage daily. Set up alerts if daily usage exceeds a predefined budget (e.g., $5/day).
- **n8n:** Monitor n8n execution counts and resource usage (CPU/Memory) on the self-hosted instance to ensure the VPS size is appropriate and to prevent unexpected hosting costs.
