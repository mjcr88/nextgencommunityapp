## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

#### Sofia - The Newcomer (Seeking Safety & Discovery)
- **Context**: Just arrived at Ecovilla, overwhelmed by new environment
- **Needs**: Reassurance and gradual introduction to community, clear wayfinding and helpful onboarding
- **Emotional Need**: "I'm overwhelmed and don't want to make a mistake"
- **Design Response**: Psychological safety through softness, progressive disclosure, warm welcome sequences

#### Marcus - The Organizer (Seeking Speed & Power)
- **Context**: Active community coordinator managing multiple initiatives, drowning in coordination tasks
- **Needs**: Efficiency, power tools and shortcuts over hand-holding
- **Emotional Need**: "I'm drowning in tasks and need efficiency"
- **Design Response**: Power tools, bulk operations, keyboard shortcuts, undo over confirm dialogs

#### Elena - The Balanced Resident (Seeking Calm & Control)
- **Context**: Established resident maintaining healthy community engagement
- **Needs**: Stay connected without being overwhelmed, values quality over quantity
- **Emotional Need**: "I want to stay connected without being overwhelmed"
- **Design Response**: Smart filtering, weekly digests, "you're all caught up" states, bulletproof Focus Mode

#### Carmen - The Resource Coordinator (Seeking Organization & Visibility)
- **Context**: Manages community resources, tool library, harvest sharing
- **Needs**: Clear inventory visibility and transaction tracking
- **Emotional Need**: "I need to keep track of everything without chaos"
- **Design Response**: Clear status indicators, streamlined workflows, admin tools that feel empowering

---

### Usability Goals

1. **Ease of Learning**: New users can complete core tasks (profile setup, first check-in, browse calendar) within 5 minutes
2. **Efficiency of Use**: Power users can access frequent features (check-in, calendar view, exchange search) within 2 taps from home
3. **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for destructive actions (deactivate account, delete listing)
4. **Memorability**: Infrequent users can return after weeks without relearning navigation
5. **Mobile-First Performance**: 90% of usage on mobile, <3 second load times, touch-optimized throughout

---

### Design Principles

1. **Regenerative by Design** - Every interaction should leave users feeling energized, not depleted. Design reduces overwhelm rather than creating it.

2. **Belonging Through Inclusivity** - Design for all personas simultaneously with multiple entry points for different needs and comfort levels.

3. **Nature as North Star** - Visual language rooted in organic forms and earth elements. Calming palette derived from Costa Rican cloud forest landscapes.

4. **Efficiency with Warmth** - Streamlined flows without coldness. Human-centered copy that guides without condescending.

5. **Mindful Transparency** - Honest information delivery with no dark patterns. Clear privacy controls. Users always know what's happening and why.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Overview

**Philosophy**: Every animation serves a purpose - to guide attention, create continuity, communicate state, or spark joy. Motion makes the digital feel alive and believable. We treat the UI not as static screens, but as a connected, flowing experience - like a movie where each scene transitions seamlessly into the next.

**Emotional Design Approach**: Inspired by Duolingo's beloved owl mascot, we use character-driven design to create emotional connection, celebrate progress, provide encouragement, and make the app feel alive and personal.

### Motion Design Principles

#### The Five Pillars of Ecovilla Motion

**1. Making Interactive Possibilities Immediately Apparent**

Visual language that signals "this is interactive" before any touch:

- **Buttons breathe**: Subtle scale pulse (1.0 ‚Üí 1.02 ‚Üí 1.0) on a 3-second loop when idle
- **Swipeable cards show depth**: Shadow increases on drag, revealing the action beneath
- **Draggable elements lift**: Gentle elevation increase on press (z-index + shadow)
- **Links have personality**: Underline slides in from left on hover (100ms)
- **Floating Action Buttons pulse**: Soft glow pulse to draw attention to primary actions

**Implementation** (using Magic UI + custom CSS):
```tsx
// Breathing button
<Button className="animate-pulse-subtle">
  Create Event
</Button>

// CSS
@keyframes pulse-subtle {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.02); }
}
.animate-pulse-subtle {
  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**2. Creating Responsive Interfaces with Immediate Visual Response**

Every interaction gets instant feedback (0-50ms response time):

- **Button press**: Immediate scale down to 0.95, then spring back (150ms total)
- **Input focus**: Border color + subtle glow transition in 150ms
- **Toggle switches**: Smooth 200ms slide + background color fade
- **Icon state changes**: Micro-bounce effect on state change (checkmarks, favorites)
- **Touch ripple**: Expanding circle from touch point (Material Design inspired)

**Timing Standards**:
- **Immediate response**: 0-50ms (must feel instant)
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-300ms (button press, toggle, checkbox)
- **Transitions**: 300-500ms (screen change, modal, drawer)
- **Animations**: 500-1000ms (celebrations, illustrations)
- **Ambient motion**: 2-5s loops (breathing, floating, gentle sway)

**Easing Functions**:
```css
/* Enter screen - Smooth deceleration */
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);

/* Exit screen - Quick acceleration */
--ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0);

/* Spring bounce - Playful energy */
--ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);

/* Standard - Material Design default */
--ease-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
```

**3. Creating Spatial Continuity Through Purposeful Motion**

Elements move in ways that show relationships and maintain orientation:

- **Screen transitions**: Elements slide from navigation direction (left = back, right = forward)
- **Modal appearance**: Expands from tap location to full size (shared element transition)
- **Deleted items**: Collapse height ‚Üí slide out ‚Üí gap closes (300ms total)
- **Card to detail**: Card morphs and expands into detail view (500ms)
- **Tab switching**: Content slides left/right based on tab order

**Example - Card to Detail Transition**:
```tsx
// Using Magic UI's MorphingCard
<MorphingCard
  from="list"
  to="detail"
  duration={400}
  easing="ease-out"
>
  {/* Card content */}
</MorphingCard>
```

**4. Creating Believable Digital Experiences Through Natural Movement**

Motion follows physics, not mathematics:

- **Use spring physics over linear**: React Spring or Framer Motion for natural feel
- **Heavier elements have inertia**: Modals, drawers move slower than small elements
- **Follow-through and overlap**: Title animates, then content (staggered by 50-100ms)
- **Subtle parallax on scroll**: Background moves slower (0.5x speed) than foreground
- **Momentum and drag**: Swipe gestures have natural deceleration curves

**5. Communicating System Status Through Immediate Visual Response**

The app always tells you what it's doing:

- **Loading**: Skeleton screens morph into real content (Magic UI `<Skeleton>`)
- **Processing**: Progress indicators with estimated time
- **Success**: Green checkmark with subtle celebration (200ms)
- **Error**: Red shake animation + icon change (300ms)
- **Typing indicator**: Pulsing dots that feel "alive" (AI chat)
- **Uploading**: Progress bar with percentage and file preview

**State Transition Examples**:
```tsx
// Loading ‚Üí Content
<FadeIn delay={200}>
  {isLoading ? (
    <Skeleton className="h-20 w-full" />
  ) : (
    <EventCard data={event} />
  )}
</FadeIn>

// Success celebration
<AnimatedCheckmark
  size={64}
  color="forest-canopy"
  duration={500}
  onComplete={() => navigate('/home')}
/>
```

### Character System: Emotional Design Through Avatars

#### The Hummingbird Guide - App Mascot

**Personality**: Energetic, helpful, encouraging, always ready to assist. The hummingbird is your companion throughout the Ecovilla journey - never intrusive, but always there when needed.

**Visual Design**:
- **Style**: Friendly, slightly stylized illustration (not cartoon, not photorealistic)
- **Colors**: Vibrant plumage using Ecovilla palette (Forest Canopy greens, Sunrise accents)
- **Expressions**: 5-7 emotional states (happy, thoughtful, excited, encouraging, celebrating)
- **Size**: Scales from 32px (small appearances) to 200px (major moments)

**Where the Hummingbird Appears**:

1. **Onboarding**:
   - Welcomes new residents on password setup screen
   - Flies in from right, hovers center (2s loop animation)
   - Speech bubble: "Welcome to Ecovilla! Let's get you set up."
   - Celebrates completion: Does a little loop-de-loop

2. **Empty States**:
   - No events: Hummingbird sitting on branch, looking peaceful
   - No check-ins: Hummingbird looking at map curiously
   - Search no results: Hummingbird looking through magnifying glass
   - Message: Conversational, not apologetic

3. **Tutorials & Tips**:
   - First check-in: "Great spot! Others nearby can see you're here."
   - First event created: "Your event is live! I'll remind attendees."
   - Weekly digest: Small hummingbird icon next to "Your week ahead"

4. **Achievements** (future feature):
   - First month celebration
   - 10 check-ins milestone
   - Community helper badge
   - Hummingbird does celebratory flight pattern

5. **AI Assistant Avatar**:
   - Hummingbird face as AI chat avatar
   - Animated when "typing" (gentle head tilt, eye blink)
   - Different expressions based on response type

6. **Loading States**:
   - Hummingbird flies across screen trailing sparkles
   - Alternative: Hummingbird hovers with gentle wing flutter
   - Use sparingly - skeleton screens preferred for most loading

**Animation States**:
```tsx
// Hummingbird component with states
<Hummingbird
  state="celebrating" // happy, thoughtful, excited, encouraging, celebrating
  size={128}
  loop={true}
  onAnimationComplete={() => {}}
/>
```

#### Personal Animal Avatars - User Identity

**Purpose**: Give each resident a unique, playful identity that appears throughout their experience. Like Duolingo's owl, these animals create emotional connection and personality.

**12 Costa Rican Animals**:

1. **Resplendent Quetzal** ü¶ú - Elegant, rare, spiritual
2. **Three-Toed Sloth** ü¶• - Slow living, calm, regenerative

### Transition Choreography: Screens as Connected Scenes

**Philosophy**: Instead of discrete screens that pop in/out, create flowing transitions that maintain spatial continuity and user orientation.

#### Onboarding Flow - Single Stage, Morphing Content

**Problem**: Traditional approach = 6 separate screens feel disconnected  
**Solution**: One "stage" where content morphs and transitions

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Onboarding container maintains context
<OnboardingStage>
  {/* Step indicator always visible */}
  <ProgressBar current={step} total={6} />
  
  {/* Content area morphs between steps */}
  <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
    <motion.div
      key={step}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      {renderCurrentStep()}
    </motion.div>
  </AnimatePresence>
  
  {/* Navigation buttons stay in place */}
  <NavigationButtons />
</OnboardingStage>
```

**Step Transitions**:
- Current step fades + slides left (-20px)
- New step fades + slides in from right (+20px)
- Progress bar smoothly fills (500ms, ease-out)
- Button labels morph (Next ‚Üí Continue ‚Üí Complete Setup)
- No screen "flash" - continuous experience

**Special Moments**:
- **Step 2 (Choose Animal)**: Grid of animals fades in staggered (50ms delay each)
- **Step 4 (Interests)**: Selected chips smoothly rearrange to top
- **Completion**: All content fades up, hummingbird flies in with celebration

#### Home Feed - Living, Breathing Content

**Feed Items Entrance**:
```tsx
// Staggered fade + slide for feed items
<FadeIn delay={index * 50} direction="up" distance={20}>
  <FeedCard />
</FadeIn>
```

**Pull-to-Refresh**:
1. Pull down: Hummingbird slides into view, pulling indicator
2. Release threshold: Hummingbird does a little flip
3. Loading: Hummingbird hovers with wing flutter
4. Content loads: Items cascade in (50ms stagger)
5. Hummingbird flies away

**"All Caught Up" State**:
- Last feed item fades out bottom
- "All caught up" section fades in from center
- Hummingbird lands on branch, settles into idle pose
- Soft glow pulse around checkmark
- Message fades in: "That's everything new today!"

#### Modal & Overlay Transitions

**Bottom Sheet (Mobile)**:
```tsx
<AnimatedBottomSheet
  from="bottom"
  snapPoints={[0.5, 0.9]}
  dragHandle={true}
  springConfig={{ tension: 300, friction: 30 }}
>
  {/* Content */}
</AnimatedBottomSheet>
```

- Slides up with spring physics (feels natural, not robotic)
- Drag handle shows it's interactive
- Background dimming synchronized with slide (opacity matches position)
- Dismiss: Flick down, smooth deceleration

**Dialog (Desktop)**:
```tsx
<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger>Open</DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent
    initial={{ scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
    exit={{ scale: 0.95, opacity: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
  >
    {/* Content fades in 100ms after container */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

- Expands from center (scale 0.9 ‚Üí 1.0)
- Background blurs behind (backdrop-filter)
- Content staggers in (50ms after container)

#### Navigation Transitions

**Tab Switching (Bottom Nav)**:
```tsx
<TabContent
  direction={newTab > oldTab ? 'left' : 'right'}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: 'easeInOut' }}
>
  {/* Tab content */}
</TabContent>
```

- Content slides in direction of navigation
- Previous content slides out opposite direction
- Tab indicator smoothly slides to new position
- Icon scales up slightly when selected (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1)

**Screen-to-Screen (Stack Navigation)**:
- Forward: New screen slides from right, old screen slides left (parallax)
- Back: Reverse animation
- Previous screen visible behind (depth perception)
- 300ms duration, ease-out curve

---

### Component-Level Animations

#### Buttons

**States & Transitions**:
```tsx
<Button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.15, ease: 'easeInOut' }}
>
  Click Me
</Button>
```

- **Idle**: Subtle breathe (optional, for primary CTAs)
- **Hover**: Scale 1.05, shadow deepens (desktop only)
- **Press**: Scale 0.95 instantly, spring back
- **Loading**: Spinner fades in, text fades out
- **Success**: Checkmark replaces text (500ms)

#### Form Inputs

**Focus Animation**:
```tsx
<Input
  onFocus={() => setBorderColor('forest-canopy')}
  transition={{ duration: 0.15 }}
/>
```

- Border color change: 150ms
- Label slides up (if floating label)
- Subtle glow appears
- Helper text fades in below

**Validation**:
- ‚úÖ **Success**: Green border, checkmark fades in right
- ‚ùå **Error**: Red border, shake animation (300ms), error text fades in

**Shake Animation**:
```css
@keyframes shake {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateX(0); }
  10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% { transform: translateX(-4px); }
  20%, 40%, 60%, 80% { transform: translateX(4px); }
}
```

#### Cards

**Hover State (Desktop)**:
```tsx
<Card
  whileHover={{
    y: -4,
    boxShadow: '0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)'
  }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
>
  {/* Content */}
</Card>
```

**Tap Feedback (Mobile)**:
- Scale down to 0.98 on press
- Quick spring back on release

**Loading State**:
- Skeleton version with pulsing gradient
- Morphs into real content (crossfade 300ms)

#### Lists & Feeds

**Item Entrance**:
```tsx
{items.map((item, i) => (
  <FadeIn key={item.id} delay={i * 50} direction="up">
    <ListItem data={item} />
  </FadeIn>
))}
```

- Each item delayed by 50ms (stagger effect)
- Fade + slide from below (20px)
- Max stagger: 300ms (after 6 items, no additional delay)

**Item Removal**:
1. Swipe gesture initiates
2. Item slides out direction of swipe
3. Opacity fades to 0
4. Height collapses to 0 (150ms)
5. Gap closes, items below slide up

#### Toggles & Switches

```tsx
<Switch
  checked={enabled}
  onCheckedChange={setEnabled}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2, ease: 'easeOut' }}
>
  <SwitchThumb />
</Switch>
```

- Thumb slides across track (200ms)
- Background color fades (200ms, synchronized)
- Haptic feedback on mobile (if supported)
- Slight bounce at end position (spring)

---

### Accessibility & Performance Considerations

#### Reduced Motion Support

**Respect user preferences**:
```tsx
const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: prefersReducedMotion ? 0.01 : 0.3 }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

**When reduced motion enabled**:
- Transitions become instant crossfades
- Movement animations disabled
- Scale/rotation animations disabled
- Position changes become instant
- Maintain state changes (still show success/error)

#### Battery & Performance

**Conditional Animations**:
- Disable ambient animations (breathing buttons) on low battery
- Reduce particle effects on older devices
- Skip non-essential decorative animations
- Maintain functional animations (loading, state changes)

**Optimization**:
- Use CSS transforms (not position properties)
- GPU-accelerated animations (transform, opacity)
- RequestAnimationFrame for JavaScript animations
- Lazy load animation libraries
- Preload character illustrations

---

### Implementation Checklist

When implementing any animation:

- [ ] Duration follows standards (150-500ms for most)
- [ ] Easing curve appropriate for direction
- [ ] Respects reduced motion preference
- [ ] Works on low-end devices
- [ ] Provides functional value (not just decoration)
- [ ] Tested on real mobile devices
- [ ] Doesn't block user interaction
- [ ] Enhances understanding (communicates state/relationship)
- [ ] Feels natural and believable
- [ ] Delights without annoying

**Next Section**: Content & Micro-copy Guidelines (voice, tone, messaging throughout the app)

---

## Content & Micro-copy Guidelines

### Overview

**Philosophy**: Words matter as much as design. Every message is an opportunity to build trust, provide clarity, and strengthen community connection. Our copy should feel like a helpful neighbor, not a corporate system - warm, clear, and respectful of people's time.

**Golden Rule**: Write for humans, not robots. Read every message aloud - if it sounds awkward or robotic, rewrite it.

---

### Voice & Tone Principles

#### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Warm & Welcoming** (Not Corporate)
- ‚ùå "Your account has been successfully created."
- ‚úÖ "Welcome to Ecovilla! We're excited to have you here."

**2. Clear & Helpful** (Not Condescending)
- ‚ùå "You need to complete all required fields to proceed."
- ‚úÖ "Add your name and email to continue."

**3. Encouraging** (Not Pushy)
- ‚ùå "You should RSVP to this event now!"
- ‚úÖ "Interested? Let the organizer know you're coming."

**4. Human** (Not Robotic)
- ‚ùå "Operation completed successfully."
- ‚úÖ "Done! Your event is live."

**5. Respectful** (Not Demanding)
- ‚ùå "Enable notifications to use this feature."
- ‚úÖ "Turn on notifications to get event reminders."

**6. Community-Focused** (We, Not You vs. Them)
- ‚ùå "Submit your request to the administrator."
- ‚úÖ "We'll review this and get back to you soon."

#### Tone Adaptations by Context

**Onboarding** - Warm, reassuring, patient
- "Take your time - you can always change these later."
- "Just a few more details and you're all set!"
- "Welcome home, Sofia! üå±"

**Daily Use** - Friendly, efficient, conversational
- "You're all caught up! üéâ"
- "3 new things since this morning."
- "Marcus checked in nearby."

**Errors** - Helpful, solution-focused, calm
- "Couldn't save that. Check your connection?"
- "This photo is too large. Try a smaller one?"
- "Hmm, something went wrong. Let's try that again."

**Success** - Celebratory but not excessive
- "Posted! ‚úì"
- "You're going! See you there."
- "Request sent to Maria."

**Admin/Moderation** - Professional, clear, fair
- "This event needs your review."
- "Approved and published."
- "This was flagged for: [reason]."

**Next Section**: Performance Considerations (loading strategies, optimization, caching)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Overview

**Philosophy**: Speed is a feature. Performance directly impacts user experience, especially in a mobile-first platform used in rural Costa Rica where internet connectivity may be limited. Every millisecond of delay reduces engagement and trust.

**Target**: The app should feel instant, even on 3G connections and low-end devices.

---

### Performance Goals & Budgets

#### Core Web Vitals Targets

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - ‚≠ê Primary metric for loading performance
- **Target**: < 2.5 seconds
- **Acceptable**: 2.5 - 4.0 seconds
- **Poor**: > 4.0 seconds
- **Measure**: Time until main content is visible

**First Input Delay (FID)** - Interactivity
- **Target**: < 100ms
- **Acceptable**: 100 - 300ms
- **Poor**: > 300ms
- **Measure**: Time until app responds to first interaction

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Visual stability
- **Target**: < 0.1
- **Acceptable**: 0.1 - 0.25
- **Poor**: > 0.25
- **Measure**: How much content shifts during loading

**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** - Responsiveness
- **Target**: < 200ms
- **Acceptable**: 200 - 500ms
- **Poor**: > 500ms
- **Measure**: All user interactions throughout session

#### Additional Performance Metrics

**Time to Interactive (TTI)**:
- **Target**: < 3.5 seconds (on 3G)
- **Target**: < 2.0 seconds (on 4G/WiFi)

**Total Blocking Time (TBT)**:
- **Target**: < 200ms

**Speed Index**:
- **Target**: < 3.0 seconds

**Bundle Size Budgets**:
- **Initial JS**: < 200 KB (gzipped)
- **Initial CSS**: < 50 KB (gzipped)
- **Total initial load**: < 350 KB (gzipped)
- **Per route JS**: < 100 KB (gzipped)

**Image Budgets**:
- **Hero images**: < 150 KB
- **Thumbnail images**: < 20 KB
- **Avatar images**: < 10 KB
- **Total images per page**: < 500 KB

#### Page-Specific Performance Targets

| Page | LCP Target | TTI Target | Bundle Size |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Login | < 1.5s | < 2.0s | < 100 KB |
| Home Feed | < 2.0s | < 2.5s | < 150 KB |
| Map | < 2.5s | < 3.0s | < 200 KB (maps are heavy) |
| Calendar | < 2.0s | < 2.5s | < 150 KB |
| Exchange | < 2.0s | < 2.5s | < 150 KB |
| Profile | < 1.8s | < 2.3s | < 120 KB |

---

### Loading Strategies

#### 1. Skeleton Screens (Primary Strategy)

**Principle**: Show layout immediately while content loads. Morphs into real content when ready.

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Home Feed
{isLoading ? (
  <>
    <Skeleton className="h-32 w-full mb-4" /> {/* Action card */}
    <Skeleton className="h-24 w-full mb-4" /> {/* Update */}
    <Skeleton className="h-40 w-full mb-4" /> {/* Feed item */}
    <Skeleton className="h-40 w-full mb-4" />
  </>
) : (
  <FadeIn duration={200}>
    <HomeFeedContent data={feedData} />
  </FadeIn>
)}
```

**Where to use**:
- Home feed items
- Calendar events
- Exchange listings
- Profile cards
- Map location details
- Any content > 500ms load time

**Design Requirements**:
- Match actual content dimensions
- Use Cloud (#F8F6F3) background
- Subtle shimmer animation (2s loop)
- Smooth morph to real content (200ms crossfade)

#### 2. Progressive Loading

**Strategy**: Load critical content first, defer non-critical.

**Priority Levels**:

**Critical (Load immediately)**:
- Navigation (bottom tabs)
- Screen header
- Primary content area skeleton
- Core authentication check

**High Priority (Load in first 1s)**:
- First 3-5 feed items
- User's own data (check-ins, events, listings)
- Immediate viewport content

**Medium Priority (Load in first 2s)**:
- Below-the-fold content
- Images (lazy load)
- Secondary features
- Analytics

**Low Priority (Load when idle)**:
- Prefetch next routes
- Image preloading
- Background data sync
- Non-critical tracking

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Use React.lazy for route splitting
const Calendar = lazy(() => import('./pages/Calendar'))
const Exchange = lazy(() => import('./pages/Exchange'))

// Wrap in Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<PageSkeleton />}>
  <Calendar />
</Suspense>
```

#### 3. Code Splitting

**By Route**:
```
/login        ‚Üí 80 KB
/home         ‚Üí 120 KB
/map          ‚Üí 180 KB (includes map library)
/calendar     ‚Üí 100 KB
/exchange     ‚Üí 110 KB
/ai-assistant ‚Üí 90 KB
/admin/*      ‚Üí 150 KB (admin-only code)
```

**By Feature**:
- Auth flow: Separate bundle
- Map components: Lazy load when Map tab accessed
- Rich text editor: Load on demand (event creation)
- Image cropper: Load on demand (profile photo)
- Chart libraries: Load only in admin

**Shared Chunks**:
- Common components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Utility functions (date formatting, validation)
- shadcn/ui components used across routes
- Icon library (Lucide) - tree-shaken to used icons only

#### 4. Lazy Loading

**Images**:
```tsx
<img
  src={imageUrl}
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  alt={description}
  width={width}
  height={height} // Prevent layout shift
/>
```

**Components**:
```tsx
// Heavy components loaded on interaction
const PhotoGallery = lazy(() => import('./PhotoGallery'))

// Render only when needed
{showGallery && (
  <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
    <PhotoGallery images={images} />
  </Suspense>
)}
```

**Data**:
```tsx
// Infinite scroll with pagination
const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage } = useInfiniteQuery({
  queryKey: ['feed'],
  queryFn: ({ pageParam = 0 }) => fetchFeed(pageParam),
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => lastPage.nextCursor,
})

// Load more when scrolling near bottom
useEffect(() => {
  if (inView && hasNextPage) {
    fetchNextPage()
  }
}, [inView])
```

---

### Image Optimization

#### Format Strategy

**Modern Formats (Primary)**:
- **WebP**: 25-35% smaller than JPEG
- **AVIF**: 50% smaller than JPEG (if supported)
- **Fallback**: JPEG/PNG for older browsers

**Implementation**:
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

#### Size Breakpoints

**Responsive Images**:
```tsx
<img
  srcset="
    image-400w.webp 400w,
    image-800w.webp 800w,
    image-1200w.webp 1200w
  "
  sizes="
    (max-width: 640px) 100vw,
    (max-width: 1024px) 50vw,
    33vw
  "
  src="image-800w.webp"
  alt="Description"
/>
```

**Standard Sizes**:
- **Thumbnail**: 100x100px, < 10 KB
- **Avatar**: 120x120px, < 10 KB
- **Card image**: 400x300px, < 50 KB
- **Detail image**: 800x600px, < 100 KB
- **Hero image**: 1200x675px, < 150 KB

#### Compression

**Targets**:
- JPEG: 80% quality (good balance)
- WebP: 75% quality (visually lossless)
- PNG: TinyPNG or pngquant compression
- SVG: SVGO optimization

**Tools**:
- ImageOptim (Mac)
- Squoosh (web-based)
- Sharp (server-side Node.js)
- Next.js Image Optimization (automatic)

#### Image Loading Techniques

**Blur Placeholder**:
```tsx
<Image
  src={highResImage}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={base64TinyImage} // 10px width preview
  alt="Description"
/>
```

**Progressive JPEG**:
- Show low-quality version immediately
- Progressive enhancement as data loads
- Better perceived performance

**Lazy Loading with Intersection Observer**:
```tsx
const { ref, inView } = useInView({
  triggerOnce: true,
  threshold: 0.1,
})

<div ref={ref}>
  {inView ? (
    <img src={image} alt="Description" />
  ) : (
    <Skeleton className="h-40 w-full" />
  )}
</div>
```

### Caching Strategies

#### Service Worker Caching

**Cache-First Strategy** (Static assets):
```javascript
// Cache CSS, JS, fonts immediately
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\.(?:js|css|woff2)$/,
  new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'static-assets',
    plugins: [
      new workbox.expiration.ExpirationPlugin({
        maxEntries: 60,
        maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
      }),
    ],
  })
)
```

**Network-First Strategy** (Dynamic content):
```javascript
// API calls - network first, fallback to cache
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\/api\/.*/,
  new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst({
    cacheName: 'api-cache',
    plugins: [
      new workbox.expiration.ExpirationPlugin({
        maxEntries: 50,
        maxAgeSeconds: 5 * 60, // 5 minutes
      }),
    ],
  })
)
```

**Stale-While-Revalidate** (Images):
```javascript
// Show cached image, update in background
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|webp|avif|svg)$/,
  new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate({
    cacheName: 'images',
    plugins: [
      new workbox.expiration.ExpirationPlugin({
        maxEntries: 100,
        maxAgeSeconds: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
      }),
    ],
  })
)
```

#### Browser Caching (Cache-Control Headers)

**Static Assets** (immutable):
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

**HTML**:
```
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
```

**API Responses**:
```
Cache-Control: private, max-age=300 // 5 minutes
```

**User-Generated Content**:
```
Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600 // 1 hour
```

#### Application-Level Caching

**React Query (TanStack Query)** - Primary data caching:
```tsx
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
})

// Example query
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['events'],
  queryFn: fetchEvents,
  staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes for events
})
```

**Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
```tsx
// Invalidate after mutation
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: createEvent,
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['events'] })
  },
})
```

**Optimistic Updates**:
```tsx
// Update UI immediately, rollback on error
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: updateProfile,
  onMutate: async (newProfile) => {
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['profile'] })
    const previousProfile = queryClient.getQueryData(['profile'])
    queryClient.setQueryData(['profile'], newProfile)
    return { previousProfile }
  },
  onError: (err, newProfile, context) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData(['profile'], context.previousProfile)
  },
})
```

### Offline Capabilities

#### What Works Offline

**‚úÖ Available Offline**:
- View cached feed items (last 20 items)
- View cached calendar events (next 7 days)
- View cached exchange listings
- View own profile
- Browse cached map data
- Read previous AI chat conversations
- View cached notifications

**üìù Queue for Sync** (when reconnected):
- Create check-in
- RSVP to events
- Create exchange request
- Edit profile
- Post comments (future feature)

**‚ùå Requires Connection**:
- Real-time check-ins on map
- New feed items
- Search (API required)
- Image uploads
- AI chat (new queries)
- Admin functions

#### Offline Detection & UI

**Connection Status**:
```tsx
const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine)

useEffect(() => {
  const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true)
  const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false)
  
  window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline)
  window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline)
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline)
    window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline)
  }
}, [])
```

**Offline Banner**:
```tsx
{!isOnline && (
  <OfflineBanner>
    Offline - Showing cached content from {lastSync}
  </OfflineBanner>
)}
```

**Offline Indicators**:
- Gray WiFi icon in top bar
- "Offline" badge on affected features
- Disabled state for online-only actions
- Helpful messages: "Connect to refresh"

#### Background Sync

**Queue Failed Requests**:
```javascript
// Register background sync
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'sync-queue') {
    event.waitUntil(syncQueuedRequests())
  }
})

// Queue request when offline
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  await queueRequest(url, method, data)
  await registration.sync.register('sync-queue')
}
```

**User Feedback**:
```
Toast: "You're offline. This will post when you reconnect."
Status: "Queued for sync"
Icon: Cloud with arrow (syncing)
```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, INP)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Route transition times
- API response times
- Error rates
- JavaScript errors

**Tools**:
- **Web Vitals Library**: Measure Core Web Vitals
- **Vercel Analytics**: Automatic RUM (if using Vercel)
- **Google Analytics 4**: Custom events + metrics
- **Sentry**: Error tracking + performance

**Implementation**:
```tsx
import { getCLS, getFID, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals'

function sendToAnalytics({ name, value, id }) {
  analytics.track('Web Vital', {
    metric: name,
    value: Math.round(value),
    id,
  })
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics)
getFID(sendToAnalytics)
getLCP(sendToAnalytics)
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics)
```

#### Performance Budgets in CI/CD

**Lighthouse CI**:
```yaml
# lighthouse-ci.yml
ci:
  collect:
    numberOfRuns: 3
  assert:
    assertions:
      first-contentful-paint: ['error', { maxNumericValue: 2000 }]
      largest-contentful-paint: ['error', { maxNumericValue: 2500 }]
      cumulative-layout-shift: ['error', { maxNumericValue: 0.1 }]
      total-blocking-time: ['error', { maxNumericValue: 200 }]
  upload:
    target: 'temporary-public-storage'
```

**Bundle Size Monitoring**:
```json
// bundlesize.json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "dist/main-*.js",
      "maxSize": "200 KB"
    },
    {
      "path": "dist/vendor-*.js",
      "maxSize": "150 KB"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fail builds if budgets exceeded**:
- Block deployment if bundle > target
- Alert team in Slack/Discord
- Require manual override with justification

### Mobile-First Optimization

#### Network Conditions

**Test on Real Conditions**:
- **Fast 3G**: 1.6 Mbps down, 750 Kbps up, 150ms RTT
- **Slow 3G**: 400 Kbps down, 400 Kbps up, 400ms RTT
- **4G**: 4 Mbps down, 3 Mbps up, 20ms RTT

**Chrome DevTools Network Throttling**:
- Use "Slow 3G" preset for testing
- Test every feature on throttled connection
- Ensure skeleton screens appear < 500ms
- No timeouts before 10 seconds

#### Device Considerations

**Low-End Devices**:
- Reduce animations (fewer particles, simpler transitions)
- Limit concurrent animations (max 3 at once)
- Debounce scroll handlers (16ms minimum)
- Reduce image quality on low memory devices

**Battery Optimization**:
- Pause animations when battery < 20%
- Reduce refresh frequency on low battery
- Disable background sync when battery saver enabled
- Stop ambient animations (breathing buttons) on low battery

**Memory Management**:
```tsx
// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = dataStream.subscribe(handleData)
  
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe()
  }
}, [])

// Cancel requests on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  
  fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
  
  return () => controller.abort()
}, [])
```

---

### Quick Wins - Immediate Optimizations

**Easy Performance Improvements**:

1. **Enable Brotli/Gzip Compression**
   - Reduces bundle size 70-80%
   - Configure on server/CDN

2. **Add `rel="preconnect"` for External Resources**:
   ```html
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://api.ecovilla.app">
   <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://cdn.ecovilla.app">
   ```

3. **Lazy Load Images**:
   ```html
   <img loading="lazy" src="..." alt="...">
   ```

4. **Add Width/Height to Images**:
   ```html
   <img width="400" height="300" src="..." alt="...">
   ```
   Prevents layout shift

5. **Preload Critical Assets**:
   ```html
   <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
   ```

6. **Use CDN for Static Assets**:
   - Images, fonts, CSS, JS
   - Geographic distribution
   - Edge caching

7. **Minify CSS/JS**:
   - Automatic with Vite/Next.js
   - Remove comments, whitespace
   - Tree-shake unused code

8. **Defer Non-Critical JavaScript**:
   ```html
   <script src="analytics.js" defer></script>
   ```

9. **Remove Unused CSS**:
   - PurgeCSS with Tailwind
   - Only ship used utility classes

10. **Optimize Third-Party Scripts**:
    - Load analytics async
    - Defer social widgets
    - Self-host Google Fonts

---

### Performance Testing Workflow

**Before Every Release**:

1. **Run Lighthouse Audit** (Desktop + Mobile)
   - Target: All scores > 90
   - Review recommendations

2. **Test on Real Devices**:
   - Mid-range Android (Samsung Galaxy A series)
   - iPhone SE (older, slower iOS device)
   - Slow 3G network simulation

3. **Check Bundle Sizes**:
   - Run `npm run analyze`
   - Review source map analyzer
   - Identify large dependencies

4. **Validate Core User Flows**:
   - Time each critical path
   - Home ‚Üí Check-in: < 5 seconds total
   - Login ‚Üí Home: < 3 seconds total
   - Search ‚Üí Results: < 2 seconds total

5. **Monitor for Regressions**:
   - Compare to previous release
   - Alert if metrics degrade > 10%
   - Investigate and fix before deploying
