5 Advanced App Design Techniques
1. Interactions & Animations
Instead of static screens, incorporate movement and custom animations to add dimension and a more satisfying experience.
Move beyond instant transitions: Animate page changes (e.g., pages sliding over) instead of having them instantly appear, which is typical of default iOS apps.
Create satisfying sequences: Design custom animation sequences for key interactions (e.g., a button rotating into a checkmark, a background expanding, text fading with a spring effect).
Leverage AI for complex coding: Use tools like "Claude Code" (or similar AI coding assistants) to generate complex interactions. The trick is to break down the animation into sub-steps and prompt the AI for each part, rather than asking for the whole sequence at once.
2. Custom Illustrations
Add personality and a unique touch, especially in empty states where the app has no data.
Elevate empty states: Instead of plain text, use custom illustrations or even animations to fill empty screens (e.g., a custom mascot searching for tasks when the search results are empty).
Use AI for variations: Start with a base mascot or illustration (ideally commissioned from an artist for originality) and feed it into an AI tool like ChatGPT to generate an infinite amount of variations for different states (e.g., taking notes, sleeping, etc.).
Consider animation: Take custom illustrations to the next level by animating them using tools like Rive.
3. Haptic Feedback
Use subtle vibrations to provide physical feedback to the user, adding depth and making the app more "fun to tap."
Apply haptics liberally (but wisely): Apple's default apps rarely use haptics; custom apps can use them on almost every button click.
Vary the intensity: Control the strength of the vibration in the code, using a lighter amount for frequent clicks (like inputting a transaction) and a heavier amount for significant actions (like changing tabs).
Focus on satisfaction: When implemented correctly in the right places, haptic feedback becomes satisfying and addictive, encouraging users to click around the app.
4. Good Icons
Spend time selecting a non-default icon pack and ensuring consistency to elevate the app's overall feel.
Avoid generic icons: Move beyond the default SF symbols to a custom icon pack (like Hero Icons) to differentiate the app.
Pick the right style: The style—minimal/thin lines, filled/heavy, or complicated—sends a different message. Consistency is paramount; avoid mixing and matching different styles.
Use style to show state: A more advanced technique is to use a different icon style (e.g., a filled/heavier version) to signify an active or selected state on elements like the tab bar, which adds more depth than just changing the color.
5. Elevate Your Design Taste
Continuously expose yourself to high-quality design to improve your aesthetic sense and ability to make good design choices.
Constant exposure: Follow talented designers on Twitter and bookmark designs you like.
Use design resources (like Mobin): Regularly scroll through vast collections of app screenshots to see how the best apps handle layouts, tab bars, and icons.
Answer specific questions: Use design catalogs to research specific elements (e.g., searching "tab bar" to see various examples) to guide your design decisions. The continuous browsing process naturally helps you discover patterns and elevate your taste over time.



This transcript is focused on the concept of emotional design as the key differentiator for modern apps, arguing that being "useful" is no longer enough. The real competitive edge lies in how the product makes the user feel.

The Power of Emotional Design in App Strategy
The core insight is that emotional design—making a product feel engaging, personal, and alive—is the hidden edge that separates good apps from great ones, leading to user retention and business growth. This intentional, feeling-based design turns users into fans.
Core Philosophy: The Long-Term Edge
Utility is not enough (0:35): With APIs, no-code tools, and AI, it's easy to build functional products. The real question is: Does your app feel smooth, delightful, playful, or premium, or just like every other app?
Design as the differentiator (1:04): While a solid business model and good timing matter, design that connects and feels intentional is what truly separates good from great.
The lasting impression (1:35): The long-term edge is not the code or the features, but how your product leaves people feeling when they close it.

Key Principles & Case Studies
The transcript analyzes three successful apps to demonstrate how emotional design translates into business growth, focusing on delight, trust, and luxury.
1. Duolingo: Delight and Habit Formation
Duolingo uses an emotional design system to encourage repeated user behavior and build habits, leading to a doubling of daily active users and paid subscribers.
Technique
Goal
Application
Character Animation System (2:24)
Make the experience feel human and alive.
Facial reactions, lip syncing, and idle animations for the mascot.
Emotional Feedback Loops (3:34)
Give instant, non-functional feedback that encourages users.
The mascot reacts (cheers/corrects) when you answer questions, rather than just showing a green checkmark.
Celebrate Small Wins (4:25)
Reinforce engagement and make the experience rewarding.
Use micro-interactions (subtle bounces, sparkles, glows) and intentional success states.
Momentum Progress (4:52)
Give a sense of building something over time.
Motion to show streaks, levels, or completed journals.

Subtle animations in security flows, fades, and hover effects that create a premium experience without "shouting" at the user.

Export to Sheets

In summary, the key to building apps people love and keep coming back to is to incorporate emotional design layers—whether through delightful mascots, subtle haptic feedback (as mentioned in the previous transcript), or premium motion—to transform a merely functional product into a connected, human, and memorable experience.



Designer Progression: Mistakes and Solutions by Level
The video uses the redesign of a single client screen to illustrate the typical "fails" and "passes" at each level.
1. Beginner Level (Unpaid, < 1 Year Experience)
At this stage, the design fundamentals are lacking, resulting in multiple, distinct failures.
Mistake
Description
Fix/Guideline
Confusing Copywriting (1:16)
Uses unnecessary words, and button labels don't clearly match the action (e.g., "earning tokens" vs. "claiming rewards").
Prioritize clarity and brevity; if unsure, simplify.
Overuse of Flashy Visuals (1:45)
Relies on overuse of gradients, blurs, and other "cool" effects without the skill to make them work.
Opt for simplicity over flashiness; a simple, clear graph is better than a fancy, confusing one.
Stressful Color Use (2:22)
Overuses a strong brand color (like red), making the UI stressful and causing everything to scream for attention.
Use the 60/30/10 Rule: 60% neutral (white/gray), 30% complementary (black/dark), 10% main brand color.
Excessive Font Variety (3:10)
Uses too many font sizes (e.g., 6) and weights (e.g., 4), destroying hierarchy and readability.
Reduce variety: Aim for ≈4 sizes and ≈2 weights.
Random Spacing & Alignment (3:46)
Elements are misaligned and spaced randomly (e.g., 11px, 25px) without a system.
Adopt the 8-Point Grid System: Use spacing and sizing values divisible by 8 (or 4).

Export to Sheets

2. Junior Level (1-3 Years Experience, Small Gigs)
The Junior designer shows progress in visuals and color restraint but still struggles with clarity and systemized structure.
Mistake
Progress/Fails
Fix/Guideline
Copywriting (5:13)
Fail: Still uses unnecessary words or unclear labels (e.g., "commit time" instead of "commit votes").
Use AI (like ChatGPT) to feed context and request copy that is clear but short.
Visuals (5:57)
Half Pass: Understands that visuals must serve a communication purpose (e.g., using a red dot for focus), but still overworks the design with trendy, skeuomorphic effects.
Continue to focus on communication over trend.
Colors (6:28)
Half Pass: Learns to be passive and avoid overusing the main brand color, which creates a clean, professional look. However, the design is now too passive and a bit dull.
Find a balance; the goal is appropriate color usage, not extreme passivity.
Fonts & Spacing (7:14)
Fail: Still struggles with having too many/too-large/too-small font sizes and random pixel values for spacing.
Reinforce the 8-Point Grid and font reduction guidelines.

3. Mid-Level Designer (3-6 Years Experience, $3K-$6K Projects)
The Mid-Level designer successfully implements fundamentals but can fall into the trap of over-designing.
Progress/Mastery
Key Characteristic
Copywriting (8:35)
Half Pass: Copy is much clearer and written with a sense of the actual user in mind.
Visuals (8:54)
Half Pass (but functional): Has a trained eye to make complex visuals work, but often overworks the design by adding unnecessary elements.
Colors (9:26)
Half Pass: Knows how to balance the UI using different shades or tints of one color instead of multiple colors.
Fonts & Spacing (9:57, 10:19)
Half Pass: Understands font usage (fewer sizes/weights) and has started to implement a spacing system (like the 8-Point Grid), leading to a more professional look.

Export to Sheets

4. Senior Designer (7+ Years Experience, $20K-$100K+ Deals)
The Senior designer achieves mastery in all static UI elements, with design decisions focused on driving business metrics.
Mastery Achieved
Key Characteristic
Copywriting (11:12)
Full Pass: Achieves better communication with less (e.g., avoiding repetition like "last 10 votes" when a "voting" label already exists), reducing cognitive load and visual clutter.
Visuals (12:00)
Full Pass: Achieves more with less, adding emphasis only where it matters and creating immediate user connections by reusing visual patterns (e.g., same pulsing circle on related elements).
Colors (12:33)
Full Pass: Simplifies color use (flat colors, no gradients) and saves the main color to effectively call attention to the right things (e.g., rewards, indicators).
Fonts & Spacing (13:00, 13:25)
Full Pass: Masters hierarchy (e.g., 4 sizes, 2 weights), uses monospace fonts for big numbers, and implements deliberate, logical structure and grouping throughout the UI.

The Hidden Mistake & The Future of Design
The single biggest mistake, even for Senior designers, is focusing too much on static screens.
The Hidden Mistake (14:26): Getting stuck on static images and not designing the flow and life of the app.
The Future (14:52): In the AI-driven era of app proliferation, the key to standing out and commanding high prices is creating memorable experiences.
The Solution (14:40): Treat UI design more like a movie by piecing static screens together in a way that makes the app a pleasure to use (i.e., focusing on motion, micro-interactions, and a holistic emotional experience).


This transcript provides five key tips and a bonus tip for "vibe coders" to transform generic, templated AI-generated apps into professional, high-quality UIs that command credibility and authority. The core idea is to go beyond simple prompts by supplying the AI with deep, structured context about design principles and user psychology.

5 Tips to Transform AI-Coded Apps
1. Token-Based Design System from Inspiration (1:20)
Instead of letting the AI guess, provide a comprehensive style guide.
Mine Inspiration: Use a tool like Mobin to download 10–12 screens from a professionally designed app in a different industry (e.g., using Airbnb for a social media blocker).
Generate Style Guide: Prompt an LLM (like GPT-4) with these images to extract a token-based system covering primary/accent colors, functional colors, typography, component styling, motion, and spacing.
Integrate Tokens: Integrate this guide into your project (e.g., an index.css file) so the AI references it for every new feature, creating a first layer of design predictability and consistency.
2. Chain of Thought Echo (6:09)
The most impactful tip: give the AI the "why" behind the design choices.
Extract Competitor Philosophy: Have the AI (e.g., Claude) analyze the inspiration screens and generate an expert explanation (or "chain of thought") on how that style guide makes the user feel a certain way (e.g., Airbnb creates emotional architecture around trust).
Tailor the Philosophy: Provide an elevator pitch for your app (problem, audience, desired user feeling). Have the AI apply the competitor's style guide philosophy to your specific problem (e.g., transforming a restricting app to feel empowering rather than punitive).
Result: The AI builds a significantly more dialed-in interface that speaks directly to the target audience (e.g., for high-achievers, shifting from an "Instagrammy" feel to a "Stripe-level clarity" executive dashboard).
3. Purposeful Interactivity (12:49)
Add subtle, responsive feedback to create a professional feel and guide the user.
Define Interactivity: Use a prompt to define interactivity based on principles like "communicating system state through immediate visual response" and "purposeful motion design."
Brainstorm and Implement: Instruct the AI to first brainstorm the top five opportunities for interactivity on a screen, and then implement the top 2–3 most impactful options.
Examples: Implementing a live counter incrementing with a subtle animation, showing UI loading indicators, or adding a shimmering effect to a primary action button on hover.
4. Consistent Icon Libraries (16:07)
A simple fix with a big impact on overall cohesion.
Be Specific: Explicitly tell the AI which high-quality icon library to use (e.g., React Lucide).
Avoid Mixing: Prevent the AI from mixing and matching icon sets (e.g., bold, filled-in icons with lighter, outlined icons), which creates a subtle but noticeable lack of polish. Consistent icons make the app feel tighter and more professional.
5. Intentional Microcopy (18:10)
Use specific language to build a brand personality and properly address your user avatar.
Define Personality: Have the AI or define yourself the brand's primary tone (e.g., technical, encouraging), formality (e.g., professional casual), and how it addresses users (e.g., referring to the user as "we" or "you").
Apply to Copy: Apply the microcopy guide to every element, especially system messages. For error handling, skip the apology and jump straight to the fix ("Here's how you fix it"). For empowerment, frame restrictions as a strategic choice ("You've chosen focus time") rather than a limitation.

Bonus Tip: Evaluator Optimizer Workflows (24:15)
When the AI's output isn't perfect, use a separate context window to tell the system to grade itself against the original guidelines. This self-correction loop generates specific, implementable feedback, dramatically improving the final result. For advanced use, this can be integrated with a tool like Playwright to grade the app based on real-time screenshots.



This transcript outlines the top five app design trends for 2025, focusing on how each trend enhances user experience (UX) and engagement.

Top 5 App Design Trends for 2025
1. Emotional Design (0:05)
This is a UX trend that uses elements like color, characters, or microcopy to produce an emotional response, encouraging users to return and even share the app.
Goal: Create familiarity and an emotional bond with the user.
Key Example: Duolingo's character, Duo, which cheers users on and displays a range of emotions (distressed, angry, worried) when the user stops using the app.
Future Integration: This is expected to integrate with AI, allowing characters to become realistic personas with whom users can form bonds.
2. Chatbot Design (1:18)
Driven by the rise of AI models, this trend focuses on innovative ways to display and interact with conversational AI within an app.
Design Considerations: How text inputs and photo uploads are handled; the visual presentation of AI messages (e.g., fading in, streaming); and the appearance of loading bars.
Key Example: Perplexity, which lays out information with sources and related topics, making the experience feel more like a search engine than a chat. It uses skeletons, placeholders, and streaming text to ensure the user always feels that "something's happening on the page."
3. Glassmorphism / Liquid Glass (3:30)
This trend involves elements with a glassy look—showing reflections, a slight blur, and elements beneath them, creating a 3D perspective.
Aesthetic: The elements look cool, often featuring a subtle shine on the edges.
Skepticism: While visually appealing in tech demos, the presenter is skeptical about its real-world application, noting that it often reduces accessibility and usability by making text harder to read, prioritizing beauty over function.
4. Illustrations (4:40)
This involves using characters and visual elements to add personality and vibrancy to apps, particularly in verticals like education and mental health.
Goal: To make the app more interesting and engaging.
Connection: Closely linked to Emotional Design.
Ease of Use: It's easier than ever to create these vector graphics (e.g., via Figma) and integrate them into interactive designs (e.g., using Webflow interactions), especially when they include slight animations to make them feel "alive."
5. Micro Animations (5:25)
The presenter's favorite trend, micro animations are subtle effects that occur during interactions, such as clicking an element, transitioning between pages, or pressing a button.
Effect: Creates a fluid and enjoyable user experience, encouraging the user to stay on the app.
Examples: Subtle movements in graphs that slide in as they are viewed, or smooth effects when an element is clicked.

Webflow Animations with GSAP (2:28)
The video also includes a separate segment highlighting GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), now integrated into Webflow. GSAP uses JavaScript to create complex, smooth animations (like text drop-in or stroke animations on SVGs) with features like timelines and easing, offering motion that is superior to basic CSS. This feature is now entirely free to use within Webflow.


5 Advanced UX/UI Design Tips
1. Personalize the Experience Based on User Behavior (0:25)
Instead of showing every user the same screen, adapt the interface based on where they are in their product journey (new, repeat, or super user).
New User: Keep it simple, focus on onboarding, welcoming the user, and encouraging them to set initial goals.
Repeat User: Provide clear routine-focused content, such as the workout plan for the day with relevant details (duration, calories).
Super User: Offer an advanced, data-rich experience, starting with key statistics (steps, calories, heart rate) and personalized suggestions for optimization.
Principle: Great design meets people where they are, making the product feel smarter, more personal, and more valuable.
2. Design Smarter Search (2:14)
Go beyond a basic search bar by using the "moment of intent" (when a user taps the bar) to offer helpful, non-obtrusive guidance.
Standard Search (The Missed Opportunity): A blank screen that offers no guidance and forces the user to do all the work.
Smarter Search: The interface instantly offers subtle, useful suggestions:
Recent Searches: To help users quickly pick up where they left off.
Popular Items: To show what others are finding useful.
Personalized Recommendations: Based on past behavior or interests.
Principle: Suggestions reduce friction for unsure users without getting in the way of those who know exactly what they want to type.
3. Smarter Order Tracking Design (3:42)
The post-purchase experience (the moment between payment and delivery) is full of expectation and uncertainty, and the design must reduce stress.
Basic Order Screen: A "data dump" of information (order number, text list, simple dates) that forces the user to scan and interpret everything.
Upgraded Design: Makes the user feel "under control":
Confident Messaging: Opens with a clear, positive message ("Your order is on the way").
Humanized Courier Section: Includes a photo, name, and quick access to call/message, adding trust and personality.
Visual Timeline: The order history is presented as a visual timeline instead of text and dates, allowing users to instantly see the order's current stage.
Principle: Great design doesn't just display information; it reduces stress and answers questions before they are asked.
4. Cohesive Category Screens (6:30)
The design of category screens significantly affects how users navigate the product and should prioritize scannability and visual consistency over flashiness.
Basic Version: A simple list of text links; functional but lacks visual hierarchy and forces the user to read every label.
Junior Designer Version: Uses busy images with dark overlays, often resulting in poor contrast and text readability issues. The lack of visual consistency across images (a mix of bright, moody, or stock photos) makes the screen feel random.
Professional Version: Uses stylistically unified images (e.g., clean, isolated images) and color-coded charts with soft, solid backgrounds.
Principle: The layout should have a visual rhythm that makes scanning effortless, ensuring the entire screen feels cohesive and branded.
5. Choose the Right Input Method for the Moment (8:12)
The UI component used to enter numerical data must match the user's need (one-time setup vs. frequent, repetitive entry).
Scroll Wheels and Sliders: Best for casual, one-time setup inputs (e.g., age, initial height/weight) where precision is low-effort and the value falls within a known range. They are low-effort and quick for setup.
Text Fields, Steppers, or Number Inputs: Best for frequent, precise, or repetitive tasks (e.g., logging 350g of food). Sliders are too slow and fiddly for this repeated, precision-critical use case.
Rule of Thumb: Match the input method to the context to reduce friction.



This video provides a comprehensive guide on designing an intuitive and polished bottom navigation bar for mobile apps, emphasizing that a poor design frustrates users and leads to abandonment. The advice covers essential fundamentals, spacing, visual consistency, and advanced micro-interactions.

The Fundamentals of Bottom Navigation
The bottom navigation bar (called a Tab Bar on iOS and Bottom Navigation on Android) is the backbone of an app's usability and represents its top-level structure. It is one of the most frequently used areas of a mobile app.
1. Prioritize Core Features
The navigation bar should contain only the most essential, frequently used screens or actions.
Good Candidates
Bad Candidates
Home/Main Feed, Search/Discover, Add/Create (main action), Messages/Notifications, Profile/Account
Help/FAQ, Log Out, Legal Pages (e.g., Privacy Policy), Back/Forward buttons (which belong in top navigation)


CTA Button: Including a central, prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button (like "Create" or "Post") is a smart move for easy thumb access.
2. Understand Your Users
Design choices, such as adding labels, depend on your target audience.
Tech-Savvy/Younger Audience: You can use a minimalist approach with just icons.
Older/Less Tech-Familiar Audience: Labels below icons are crucial for clarity, confidence, and accessibility.
3. Limit the Number of Tabs
Avoid overloading the navigation bar to prevent clutter and choice paralysis.
Golden Rule: Aim for three to five tabs, with a maximum of six. This ensures each tab is large enough to be easily tapped.

Visual Design and Consistency
4. Choose the Right Sizes and Spacing
Ensure the design fits the device and is easily tappable without feeling cramped.
Icon Size: Generally, 24 pixels is a good balance.
Label Size: The sweet spot is 10 to 12 pixels to avoid clutter and accessibility issues.
5. Respect the Home Indicator Safe Area (The Pro Mistake)
A common mistake is overlapping the navigation bar onto the device's Home Indicator (the thin line at the bottom).
Fix: Respect the device's safe area. Ensure your navigation bar sits above the home indicator with enough spacing to prevent users from accidentally triggering the "go home" gesture when tapping icons.
6. Design Thumb-Friendly Tap Areas
To improve usability and accessibility, ensure the tap area is large enough for a thumb.
Size: A common convention is a tap area of at least .
7. Differentiate Active and Inactive States
Make it immediately obvious where the user is in the app.
Recommendation: Apply at least two visual changes to the active state. A great pattern is shifting the icon from Outline  Filled along with a change in Color and making the Label Text Bolder/Darker.
8. Stick to One Icon Style
Consistency is key to visual harmony.
Rule: Use a consistent style (e.g., all outline) across all inactive tabs. The only exception is the selected state, where switching an outline icon to a filled version is an excellent way to highlight the active tab.
Complexity: Ensure the complexity of all icons is consistent (minimal  minimal).
9. Keep it Clean and Simple (Color and Contrast)
Colors: Avoid using too many colors or giving each tab its own color. Stick to your brand's neutral palette (white, gray, dark tones) for the bar itself, reserving brighter colors for key actions in the main content.
Inactive State Contrast: Avoid poor contrast. Instead of using drastically different colors, slightly reduce the opacity of inactive elements. Aim for a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for graphical elements.
10. Separate from Main Content (The Big Mistake)
The biggest mistake even pro designers make is not visually separating the bottom navigation from the main content.
Solutions:
Add a subtle soft outline or one-pixel border above the bar.
Use a slight background color difference (e.g., light gray bar on a white screen).
Apply a small, soft shadow above the bar to create a "floating" or elevated effect.

The Next Level: Micro-Interactions
Once the fundamentals are solid, add micro-interactions to make the app feel responsive, polished, and fun.
Tap Feedback: Show a quick visual response when an icon is tapped (color change, scale up, ripple effect).
Tab Switching: Add smooth transitions, like a sliding underline or an animation that subtly moves the icon into place.
Screen Transitions: Use a soft fade or side slide when switching screens so it doesn't feel like the user "teleported."

8 Common Beginner UI/UX Mistakes and How to Fix Them
1. User Flow (0:23)
Beginners often miss critical steps, hidden states, and navigation in the overall user journey.
Mistake: Missing key interactive elements (e.g., a search bar for allergies beyond the presets) or necessary actions (e.g., a skip button if the user has no allergies).
Fix: Plan out the entire flow (even with paper sketches) to catch missing elements like navigation links, filters (e.g., a filter icon on the search bar), save buttons, and necessary dynamic interactions (like button hovers or micro-interactions).

2. Overusing Effects (1:06)
Excessive use of shadows, gradients, and glows makes a design look amateur and cluttered.
Mistake (Gradients): Using gradients with clashing colors (e.g., blue and green).
Fix (Gradients): Remove the gradient completely for a cleaner look, or, if a gradient is necessary, stick to variations of the same color (e.g., a darker and lighter green).
Mistake (Drop Shadows): Using harsh, high-opacity default shadows.
Fix (Drop Shadows): Change the shadow color to a light gray, significantly increase the blur, or remove the shadow entirely. Less visual noise generally equals better design.

3. Spacing (1:57)
UIs are often packed too tightly, making the content hard to read and group.
Fix 1: Grids: Set up a consistent column grid (e.g., three-column or two-column) and align elements to it.
Fix 2: Auto Layout (or equivalent): Use design tools to maintain consistent, increased vertical spacing to let elements breathe and group naturally. Mobile screens often need more space than expected.

4. Inconsistent Components (2:49)
Lack of uniform styles across repeated elements makes a design feel unpolished.
Mistake: Having different corner radiuses across cards, different styles for functionally identical elements (e.g., back and skip buttons), or mismatched search bars.
Fix:
Make identical elements (like the back and skip buttons) match in size, corner radius, and style.
Standardize the corner radius (e.g., 10 pixels for smaller components) across the entire UI.
Use Styles for colors, Variables for measurements, and Components for UI elements to ensure consistency.

5. Icons (3:36)
Using mismatched icons, or not using icons where they could speed up browsing.
Mistake 1: Not using icons on cards/lists, forcing users to read more and slowing the browsing process.
Fix 1: Add good, clear icons to cards and replace text (e.g., replacing "Save" text with a save icon).
Mistake 2: Using icons that are mismatched in fill, line width, or overall style.
Fix 2: Use a single, consistent icon library (like Feather or Phosphor) and ensure the stroke, weight, and corner styles are uniform.
Mistake 3: Using obscure icons without labels in navigation.
Fix 3: For less-known icons, use a tool-tip pop-up or labels to clarify function, especially during onboarding.
Pro Tip: It is acceptable to have different icon styles, but only if they are visually separated and used for different purposes (e.g., different styles for navigation icons, food icons, and recipe icons).

6. Redundant Elements (4:57)
Including unnecessary visual clutter that doesn't add value.
Mistake: Arrows on swipable sections, repeated elements, or unnecessary strokes/borders.
Fix:
Remove redundant arrows for actions (like swiping) that are standard on mobile.
Remove unnecessary strokes or, if contrast is a concern, dim the stroke color significantly.
Dim the color of less critical buttons to reduce visual noise.

7. Interactive Feedback (5:32)
Failing to provide visual cues when a user interacts with the app, leading to uncertainty.
Mistake: A button is clicked, but the screen takes a moment to load, making the user unsure if the click was registered.
Fix 1: Instant Feedback: Immediately gray out a button upon click to show interaction.
Fix 2: Loading State: Add a loading wheel for longer wait times.
Fix 3: Status/Confirmation: When a user saves an item (e.g., by clicking a save icon), in addition to filling in the icon, add a red dot/badge to the save tab in the navigation bar to confirm a new item has been added.

8. Charts (6:22) - Bonus Tip
Overdesigning data visualization to the point where it becomes unreadable.
Mistake: Overly aesthetic charts (e.g., from Dribbble) that lack essential context like a vertical axis, use confusing data representation (e.g., 16 bars for 7 days), or have rounded tops making it hard to tell where the bar ends.
Fix: Prioritize simplicity and clarity. Design charts that convey useful information clearly, even if they are less "aesthetic." Usability is paramount for data display.
