# Content & Micro-copy Guidelines

## Overview

**Philosophy**: Words matter as much as design. Every message is an opportunity to build trust, provide clarity, and strengthen community connection. Our copy should feel like a helpful neighbor, not a corporate system - warm, clear, and respectful of people's time.

**Golden Rule**: Write for humans, not robots. Read every message aloud - if it sounds awkward or robotic, rewrite it.

## Voice & Tone Principles

### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Warm & Welcoming** (Not Corporate)
- ‚ùå "Your account has been successfully created."
- ‚úÖ "Welcome to Ecovilla! We're excited to have you here."

**2. Clear & Helpful** (Not Condescending)
- ‚ùå "You need to complete all required fields to proceed."
- ‚úÖ "Add your name and email to continue."

**3. Encouraging** (Not Pushy)
- ‚ùå "You should RSVP to this event now!"
- ‚úÖ "Interested? Let the organizer know you're coming."

**4. Human** (Not Robotic)
- ‚ùå "Operation completed successfully."
- ‚úÖ "Done! Your event is live."

**5. Respectful** (Not Demanding)
- ‚ùå "Enable notifications to use this feature."
- ‚úÖ "Turn on notifications to get event reminders."

**6. Community-Focused** (We, Not You vs. Them)
- ‚ùå "Submit your request to the administrator."
- ‚úÖ "We'll review this and get back to you soon."

### Tone Adaptations by Context

**Onboarding** - Warm, reassuring, patient
- "Take your time - you can always change these later."
- "Just a few more details and you're all set!"
- "Welcome home, Sofia! üå±"

**Daily Use** - Friendly, efficient, conversational
- "You're all caught up! üéâ"
- "3 new things since this morning."
- "Marcus checked in nearby."

**Errors** - Helpful, solution-focused, calm
- "Couldn't save that. Check your connection?"
- "This photo is too large. Try a smaller one?"
- "Hmm, something went wrong. Let's try that again."

**Success** - Celebratory but not excessive
- "Posted! ‚úì"
- "You're going! See you there."
- "Request sent to Maria."

**Admin/Moderation** - Professional, clear, fair
- "This event needs your review."
- "Approved and published."
- "This was flagged for: [reason]."

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Is it conversational? (Does it sound natural when read aloud?)
- [ ] Is it helpful? (Does it tell the user what to do next?)
- [ ] Is it kind? (Does it blame or shame the user?)
- [ ] Is it honest? (Are we transparent about what's happening?)
- [ ] Is it actionable? (Can the user act on it immediately?)
- [ ] Is it appropriate? (Right tone for the context?)
- [ ] Is it accessible? (Clear at 8th grade reading level?)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**‚ùå Don't:**
- Use passive voice: "Your account has been created"
- Be vague: "An error occurred"
- Blame users: "You entered an invalid email"
- Use jargon: "Authentication failed"
- Be cutesy: "Oopsie! Something broke! ü§™"
- Over-explain: Three paragraphs for a simple action
- Use ALL CAPS: "IMPORTANT MESSAGE"
- End every sentence with exclamation marks!!!

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Use active voice: "We created your account"
- Be specific: "Couldn't upload photo - file too large"
- Help users: "Try a different email address"
- Use plain language: "Couldn't sign you in"
- Be warm but professional: "Hmm, something went wrong"
- Be concise: One clear sentence
- Use sentence case: "Important message"
- Use exclamation marks sparingly for genuine celebration!
