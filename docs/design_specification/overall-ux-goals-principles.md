## Usability Goals

1. **Ease of Learning**: New users can complete core tasks (profile setup, first check-in, browse calendar) within 5 minutes
2. **Efficiency of Use**: Power users can access frequent features (check-in, calendar view, exchange search) within 2 taps from home
3. **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for destructive actions (deactivate account, delete listing)
4. **Memorability**: Infrequent users can return after weeks without relearning navigation
5. **Mobile-First Performance**: 90% of usage on mobile, <3 second load times, touch-optimized throughout

## Design Principles

1. **Regenerative by Design** - Every interaction should leave users feeling energized, not depleted. Design reduces overwhelm rather than creating it.

2. **Belonging Through Inclusivity** - Design for all personas simultaneously with multiple entry points for different needs and comfort levels.

3. **Nature as North Star** - Visual language rooted in organic forms and earth elements. Calming palette derived from Costa Rican cloud forest landscapes.

4. **Efficiency with Warmth** - Streamlined flows without coldness. Human-centered copy that guides without condescending.

5. **Mindful Transparency** - Honest information delivery with no dark patterns. Clear privacy controls. Users always know what's happening and why.
