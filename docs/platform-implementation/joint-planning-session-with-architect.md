# Joint Planning Session with Architect

## Architecture Alignment Review
Confirmed alignment with Next.js/Vercel/Supabase/n8n stack. Key decision confirmed: Multi-tenant RLS on PostgreSQL.

## Implementation Strategy Collaboration
Platform layers will be sequenced as: 1. Cloud Provider Setup (AWS/Vercel/n8n host), 2. Network Foundation (Vercel Edge/Supabase VPC/n8n host networking), 3. Core Services (DNS, Logging, Monitoring).

## Risk & Constraint Discussion
**Risk:** Reliance on Supabase's managed AWS infrastructure for core data layer. **Constraint:** n8n is self-hosted, requiring secure public webhook exposure and separate infrastructure management. **Deviation:** The template assumes a traditional Kubernetes/Container Platform layer, but the architecture uses Vercel Serverless/Supabase. The subsequent sections will be adapted to focus on serverless function configuration and containerization of the n8n workflow engine.

## Implementation Validation Planning
Success criteria include RLS policy validation, Vercel Edge performance targets, and successful daily execution of the n8n Telegram ingestion workflow.

## Documentation & Knowledge Transfer Planning
Focus on runbooks for n8n and IaC documentation for OpenTofu. **Enhanced Developer Onboarding:** Create a comprehensive developer onboarding guide covering Vercel project setup, Supabase RLS basics, and n8n workflow overview. Provide example Supabase RLS policies and common patterns.
