# Container Platform Implementation (Adapted for Serverless/Managed Services)

While the template refers to a traditional "Container Platform," the Ecovilla architecture leverages a serverless and managed service approach. This section details the implementation of the application runtime and deployment platform based on Vercel (serverless functions), Supabase (managed backend), and containerized self-hosted services (n8n).

## 1. Vercel Application Platform

Vercel serves as the primary application platform, handling the deployment and execution of the Next.js frontend and backend serverless functions.

*   **Project Configuration:**
    *   Link the local development environment to the Vercel project using `vercel link`.
    *   Configure project settings in the Vercel dashboard (build command, output directory, environment variables).
    *   Set up environment-specific configurations (development, preview, production).
*   **Serverless Function Deployment:**
    *   Next.js API Routes and Server Actions are automatically deployed as Vercel serverless functions.
    *   Configure function memory, timeout, and regions via `vercel.json` if needed.
    *   Utilize Vercel's built-in Edge Functions for low-latency, globally distributed computations.
*   **Static Asset Optimization:**
    *   Leverage Vercel's automatic static optimization for images, fonts, and other assets.
    *   Configure asset compression and caching headers.

## 2. Supabase Managed Backend Services

Supabase provides managed backend services, eliminating the need for self-hosted containers for database, authentication, and storage.

*   **Database Management:**
    *   Use the Supabase dashboard and CLI for database schema migrations (`supabase db push`).
    *   Manage database backups and point-in-time recovery through Supabase's built-in features.
    *   Monitor database performance and query logs via the Supabase dashboard.
*   **Authentication Service:**
    *   Configure Supabase Auth settings (providers, email templates, rate limits).
    *   Manage user accounts and roles through the Supabase dashboard or API.
*   **Storage Service:**
    *   Configure storage buckets and access policies.
    *   Manage file uploads and CDN integration through Supabase Storage.

## 3. Containerized Self-Hosted Services (n8n)

The n8n workflow automation engine is self-hosted and should be containerized for ease of deployment and management.

*   **Containerization:**
    *   Use the official n8n Docker image (`n8nio/n8n`) for deployment.
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` if custom configurations or nodes are required.
*   **Orchestration (Docker Compose):**
    *   Define the n8n service and its dependencies (e.g., database if not using n8n's internal DB) in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   Configure environment variables for API keys, database connections, and other settings.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the containerized n8n instance to the provisioned VPS or container service.
    *   Set up process management (e.g., using `docker-compose up -d` with restart policies).
    *   Configure health checks and monitoring for the n8n container.

## 4. Node Configuration (Adapted)

In a serverless context, "node configuration" refers to the underlying compute resources for self-hosted services and local development environments.

*   **n8n Hosting Environment:**
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space on the VPS/container service based on expected workflow load.
    *   **Security Hardening:** Apply OS-level security patches, configure firewall rules, and use non-root users for running containers.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource limits for the n8n container to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Local Development Environment:**
    *   Ensure developer machines have sufficient resources to run local instances of Supabase (`supabase start`) and n8n (`docker run n8nio/n8n`).

## 5. Platform Services (Adapted)

Traditional cluster services are provided by the managed platforms or need to be configured for self-hosted services.

*   **DNS and Routing:**
    *   Vercel handles DNS and routing for the main application.
    *   Configure subdomain routing for the n8n instance (e.g., `n8n.ecovilla.app`).
*   **Certificate Management:**
    *   Vercel provides automatic SSL certificate management for the main domain.
    *   Configure SSL certificates for the n8n instance (Let's Encrypt, custom certs).
*   **Storage:**
    *   Supabase Storage provides managed object storage.
    *   For n8n, configure persistent volumes or bind mounts for workflow data and logs.

## 6. Security & Access Control (Adapted)

Security is implemented at the platform level (Vercel, Supabase) and for the self-hosted service (n8n).

*   **Vercel Security:**
    *   Configure Vercel team members and roles.
    *   Use Vercel's built-in security headers and middleware.
*   **Supabase Security:**
    *   Implement and maintain Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
    *   Configure Supabase Auth settings (JWT secrets, OAuth provider credentials).
    *   Manage API keys and database connection strings securely.
*   **n8n Security:**
    *   Configure n8n user accounts and permissions.
    *   Secure the n8n webhook endpoint (API keys, IP whitelisting).
    *   Manage secrets within n8n workflows securely (using n8n's credential system).
