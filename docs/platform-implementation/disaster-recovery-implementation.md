# Disaster Recovery Implementation

The disaster recovery implementation for the Ecovilla Community Platform ensures business continuity and data protection against various failure scenarios. This section details the backup strategies, recovery procedures, and resilience measures for all platform components.

## 1. Backup Strategy

A comprehensive backup strategy protects against data loss and system failures across all services.

*   **Vercel Application Backups:**
    *   Leverage Vercel's built-in deployment history and rollback capabilities for application code.
    *   Maintain version-controlled source code in GitHub with regular commits and proper branching strategy.
    *   Store application configuration and environment variables securely in Vercel's environment management system.
*   **Supabase Data Backups:**
    *   Utilize Supabase's automated point-in-time recovery (PITR) for database backups.
    *   Configure daily automated backups with retention periods that meet compliance requirements.
    *   Implement manual backup triggers for critical operations or before major changes.
    *   Regularly test database backup restoration procedures to ensure data can be recovered.
*   **Supabase Storage Backups:**
    *   Enable versioning for Supabase Storage buckets to maintain multiple versions of objects.
    *   Implement cross-region replication for critical storage assets where available.
    *   Maintain off-platform copies of essential storage content for disaster scenarios.
*   **n8n Workflow Backups:**
    *   Export n8n workflow definitions as JSON files and store them in version control (Git).
    *   Backup n8n database and configuration files regularly.
    *   Maintain documentation of all custom n8n nodes and their configurations.

## 2. Recovery Procedures

Well-defined recovery procedures ensure rapid restoration of services during disaster scenarios.

*   **Application Recovery:**
    *   Use Vercel's rollback feature to quickly revert to a previous working deployment.
    *   Restore application state from the latest stable code in GitHub repository.
    *   Reconfigure environment variables and secrets from secure storage.
*   **Database Recovery:**
    *   Restore Supabase PostgreSQL database from automated backups or point-in-time recovery.
    *   Validate data integrity after restoration before bringing services back online.
    *   Reapply any database schema changes that occurred after the backup point.
*   **Storage Recovery:**
    *   Restore storage objects from versioned backups or cross-region replicas.
    *   Reconfigure storage bucket policies and access controls.
*   **n8n Recovery:**
    *   Restore n8n workflows from version-controlled JSON files.
    *   Reconfigure n8n settings and credentials from secure backup.
    *   Restart n8n services and verify workflow execution.

## 3. Business Continuity Planning

Business continuity planning ensures critical platform functions remain available during and after disasters.

*   **High Availability:**
    *   Leverage Vercel's global edge network for automatic failover and load distribution.
    *   Utilize Supabase's multi-region capabilities where available for database redundancy.
    *   Implement health checks and auto-scaling for n8n services.
*   **Geographic Distribution:**
    *   Deploy application across Vercel's global edge network for geographic resilience.
    *   Consider multi-region database deployment for critical data availability.
*   **Service Dependencies:**
    *   Identify and document critical service dependencies and their failure impact.
    *   Implement fallback mechanisms for external service dependencies (Telegram API, OpenAI).

## 4. Testing and Validation

Regular testing and validation ensure disaster recovery plans are effective and up-to-date.

*   **Recovery Testing:**
    *   Conduct quarterly disaster recovery drills to test backup restoration procedures.
    *   Simulate various failure scenarios (database corruption, service outages, data loss).
    *   Measure recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
*   **Plan Updates:**
    *   Regularly review and update disaster recovery procedures based on platform changes.
    *   Update documentation when new services or components are added.
    *   Train team members on disaster recovery procedures and their roles.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

Proactive monitoring helps detect potential disaster scenarios before they occur.

*   **Health Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor backup job success/failure rates and alert on backup failures.
    *   Track database replication lag and storage availability.
    *   Monitor n8n service health and workflow execution status.
*   **Capacity Planning:**
    *   Monitor storage capacity and database growth to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Plan for backup storage requirements and retention policy compliance.
