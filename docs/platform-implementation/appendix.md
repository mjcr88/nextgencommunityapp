## E. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| n8n webhook security | Medium | High | API key authentication, IP whitelisting, regular security audits |
| Supabase performance degradation | Low | High | Monitor performance metrics, implement auto-scaling, maintain backup plans |
| Vercel deployment failures | Low | Medium | Implement rollback procedures, test deployments in staging first |
| Data loss | Low | Critical | Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures, test regularly |
| Security breach | Medium | High | Implement defense-in-depth security, conduct regular penetration testing |
