# Security & Compliance Implementation

The security and compliance implementation for the Ecovilla Community Platform follows a defense-in-depth approach, addressing security at every layer of the architecture. This section details the security controls, compliance measures, and best practices to protect the platform and its users.

## 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Controlling access to the platform and its resources is fundamental to security.

*   **Vercel Access Control:**
    *   Configure Vercel team roles (Owner, Admin, Developer, Viewer) with least-privilege principles.
    *   Implement SSO integration for centralized user management and authentication.
    *   Regularly review and audit team member access and permissions.
*   **Supabase Authentication:**
    *   Configure Supabase Auth with secure JWT settings (appropriate expiration times, secure signing).
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
    *   Set up email verification and password reset flows with proper security measures.
    *   Configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) with secure redirect URIs and scopes.
*   **n8n Access Control:**
    *   Configure n8n user accounts with role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
    *   Secure the n8n webhook endpoint with API keys or IP whitelisting.
    *   Implement strong password policies for n8n administrative accounts.

## 2. Data Security

Protecting data at rest and in transit is critical for user privacy and compliance.

*   **Encryption:**
    *   Ensure all data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS for all services (Vercel, Supabase, n8n).
    *   Enable encryption at rest for Supabase PostgreSQL database and Storage service.
    *   Use secure key management practices for encryption keys (AWS KMS or similar).
*   **Data Classification and Handling:**
    *   Classify data types (PII, PHI, community data) and apply appropriate security controls.
    *   Implement data retention policies and secure data deletion procedures.
    *   Use secure data transfer methods for backups and migrations.
*   **Row Level Security (RLS):**
    *   Implement and maintain comprehensive RLS policies in Supabase PostgreSQL to enforce multi-tenancy and data isolation.
    *   Regularly audit RLS policies to ensure they correctly enforce access controls.
    *   Test RLS policies with various user roles and data scenarios.

## 3. Network Security

Securing network communications and access points reduces the attack surface.

*   **Vercel Edge Network:**
    *   Leverage Vercel's built-in DDoS protection and security headers.
    *   Configure custom security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in Vercel middleware.
*   **Supabase Network Security:**
    *   Configure Supabase database connection pooling and network security groups.
    *   Restrict database access to specific IP ranges or VPC peering where possible.
*   **n8n Network Security:**
    *   Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the n8n instance.
    *   Use API key authentication or IP whitelisting for n8n webhook endpoints.
    *   Implement secure network segmentation between n8n and other services.

## 4. Application Security

Securing the application code and runtime environment prevents common vulnerabilities.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization in all application entry points (API routes, Server Actions).
    *   Use Zod schemas for comprehensive data validation and type safety.
    *   Sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks.
*   **Dependency Security:**
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
    *   Keep dependencies up-to-date with automated update processes.
    *   Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds and prevent supply chain attacks.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Follow secure coding guidelines and conduct regular code reviews.
    *   Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information.
    *   Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## 5. Compliance and Governance

Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and internal policies maintains trust and avoids legal issues.

*   **Privacy Compliance:**
    *   Implement privacy controls in accordance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
    *   Provide users with data access, rectification, and deletion capabilities.
    *   Maintain records of data processing activities and privacy impact assessments.
*   **Audit and Logging:**
    *   Enable comprehensive audit logging for all critical operations and access events.
    *   Implement log retention policies that meet compliance requirements.
    *   Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity or policy violations.
*   **Security Policies and Training:**
    *   Establish and maintain security policies covering all aspects of the platform.
    *   Provide regular security awareness training for developers and administrators.
    *   Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing.

## 6. Incident Response and Recovery

Having a plan for security incidents ensures rapid response and recovery.

*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan with clear roles and procedures.
    *   Establish communication protocols for security incidents.
    *   Conduct regular incident response drills and tabletop exercises.
*   **Backup and Recovery:**
    *   Implement regular automated backups for all critical data (database, storage, n8n workflows).
    *   Test backup restoration procedures regularly to ensure data can be recovered.
    *   Store backups securely with appropriate encryption and access controls.
