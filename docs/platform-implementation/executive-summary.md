# Executive Summary

The Platform Infrastructure Implementation document details the deployment and configuration of the Ecovilla Community Platform, based on the approved Fullstack Architecture Document (v2.1). The platform leverages a hybrid cloud approach, utilizing Vercel's Edge Network for the Next.js application and Supabase (PostgreSQL/RLS/Realtime) hosted on AWS `us-east-1` for the core data layer. Key implementation objectives include establishing a robust, multi-tenant foundation, implementing a container orchestration platform (adapted to Vercel/Supabase serverless functions), and setting up GitOps workflows using OpenTofu and GitHub Actions for continuous delivery. The implementation prioritizes security (RLS, input validation), performance (Vercel Edge), and resilience (Disaster Recovery planning).
