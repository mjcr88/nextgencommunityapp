# Monitoring Platform Implementation

The monitoring platform for the Ecovilla Community Platform provides comprehensive observability across the application, infrastructure, and user experience. This section details the setup and configuration of monitoring tools and practices.

## 1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Monitoring the performance and health of the Next.js application is crucial for maintaining a high-quality user experience.

*   **Vercel Analytics:**
    *   Enable Vercel Analytics to track Core Web Vitals, performance metrics, and user experience data.
    *   Configure custom events to track specific user interactions and business metrics.
    *   Set up dashboards to visualize performance trends and identify regressions.
    *   Utilize Vercel's built-in Real User Monitoring (RUM) to understand actual user performance.
*   **Error Tracking:**
    *   Integrate a dedicated error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) to capture frontend JavaScript errors, backend API route exceptions, and serverless function failures.
    *   Configure error grouping and tagging to facilitate efficient debugging.
    *   Set up alerting for critical errors and error rate thresholds.

## 2. Infrastructure Monitoring

Monitoring the health and performance of the underlying infrastructure ensures reliability and helps identify issues before they impact users.

*   **Vercel Infrastructure:**
    *   Monitor Vercel Edge Network performance, function execution times, and cold start metrics.
    *   Track build times and deployment success rates.
    *   Set up alerts for Vercel service disruptions or performance degradation.
*   **Supabase Monitoring:**
    *   Utilize Supabase's built-in monitoring dashboard to track database performance, query latency, and connection usage.
    *   Monitor Auth service metrics (login success/failure rates, token refresh rates).
    *   Track Storage service usage and performance (upload/download speeds, error rates).
*   **n8n Monitoring:**
    *   Implement health checks for the n8n instance to ensure it's running and responsive.
    *   Monitor workflow execution success/failure rates and execution times.
    *   Set up logging for workflow errors and performance bottlenecks.

## 3. Log Management

Centralized log management provides visibility into application behavior and facilitates debugging.

*   **Vercel Logs:**
    *   Utilize Vercel's built-in log streaming and retention for serverless function logs.
    *   Configure log levels (info, warn, error) appropriately to balance detail with noise.
    *   Set up log-based alerting for specific error patterns or anomalies.
*   **Supabase Logs:**
    *   Access and analyze Supabase database query logs, authentication logs, and storage logs through the Supabase dashboard.
    *   Configure log retention policies based on compliance requirements.
*   **n8n Logs:**
    *   Configure n8n to output structured logs to a file system or external logging service.
    *   Set up log rotation and retention for the n8n instance.
    *   Integrate with a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog) for unified log analysis.

## 4. User Experience Monitoring

Monitoring the actual user experience helps ensure the platform meets its performance and usability goals.

*   **Core Web Vitals:**
    *   Track LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) through Vercel Analytics.
    *   Set up alerts for Core Web Vitals that fall below target thresholds (e.g., LCP < 2.5s).
    *   Monitor performance across different devices, browsers, and geographic regions.
*   **Business Metrics:**
    *   Track key business metrics such as daily active users (DAU), weekly active users (WAU), and user engagement patterns.
    *   Monitor feature adoption rates and user journey completion rates.
    *   Set up dashboards to visualize trends and identify opportunities for improvement.

## 5. Alerting and Incident Response

Proactive alerting and a well-defined incident response process ensure issues are detected and resolved quickly.

*   **Alerting Strategy:**
    *   Define alert thresholds based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs).
    *   Implement tiered alerting (e.g., warning, critical) with appropriate escalation paths.
    *   Use alert deduplication and grouping to reduce noise and improve response efficiency.
*   **Incident Response:**
    *   Establish clear runbooks for common incident types (e.g., database performance degradation, n8n workflow failures).
    *   Define on-call rotations and escalation procedures for critical alerts.
    *   Conduct regular incident retrospectives to improve response processes and prevent recurrence.
